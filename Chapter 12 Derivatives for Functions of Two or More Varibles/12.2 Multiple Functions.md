# 12.2 Multiple Functions

In this chapter, we dive into the realm of multivariable functions, where mathematical functions become even more intriguing by involving multiple variables. Brace yourself as we explore the concepts of punctured neighborhoods, boundary points, open and closed sets, boundedness, and unboundedness. By unraveling these ideas, we'll uncover the hidden patterns and behaviors of functions in multiple dimensions. So, let's embark on this exhilarating journey and unlock the secrets of multivariable functions together!

## Introduction to Multivariable Functions

In multivariable calculus, we extend the concept of functions from single-variable calculus to functions with multiple variables. A multivariable function is a mathematical function that takes in multiple input variables and produces an output value.

## Notation

In multivariable functions, the variables are often denoted by $x,y,z$ and so on. The function itself is typically represented by $f$ or $g$, followed by the input variables in parentheses. For example, a simple multivariable function could be $f(x,y,z)$.

## Domain and Range

Similar to single-variable functions, a multivariable function has a domain and a range. The domain is the set of all possible input values for the function, while the range is the set of all possible output values. The domain and range of a multivariable function can be described using sets or specific conditions.

## Graphs and Level Curves

In multivariable calculus, we often visualize multivariable functions using graphs and level curves. The graph of a multivariable function $f(x,y)$ is a three-dimensional representation where the input variables  $x$ and $y$ correspond to the axes, and the output value $z$ corresponds to the height of the surface.

Level curves, on the other hand, are curves on the graph that represent points where the function takes on a constant value. Each level curve corresponds to a specific output value, and they can help us understand the behavior and contours of the function.

## Partial Derivatives

One important concept in multivariable calculus is partial derivatives. When differentiating a multivariable function with respect to one variable while holding the other variables constant, we obtain a partial derivative. Partial derivatives allow us to understand how the function changes with respect to each individual input variable.

## Gradient

The gradient is another important concept in multivariable calculus. It is a vector that points in the direction of the steepest increase of a function. The magnitude of the gradient represents the rate of change of the function in that direction. The gradient provides valuable information about the behavior of a multivariable function.

## Punctured Neighborhood	

In the context of multivariable calculus, a punctured neighborhood is a subset of the domain of a multivariable function that includes all points within a certain distance of a given point, excluding the point itself. Formally, a punctured neighborhood of a point $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is denoted as $N_ϵ((x_0,y_0,z_0))$, where $ϵ$ represents a positive distance from the point.

## Boundary Points

Boundary points are the points that lie on the edge or boundary of a set. For a given set, the boundary points include both points within the set and points outside the set that are adjacent to the set. Boundary points play a crucial role in determining whether a set is open or closed.

## Open Sets

An open set is a set that contains all its interior points. In other words, for every point in an open set, there exists a neighborhood of that point that lies entirely within the set. Open sets are characterized by not including their boundary points. For example, an open ball in three-dimensional space is an open set.

## Closed Sets

Conversely, a closed set is a set that contains all its boundary points. It includes both the points within the set and the boundary points. In a closed set, every convergent sequence of points within the set will have its limit also within the set. Examples of closed sets include a closed interval in one-dimensional space and a closed ball in three-dimensional space.

## Bounded Sets

A set is said to be bounded if it is contained within a finite region or can be enclosed within a finite-sized shape. In multivariable calculus, we often consider bounded sets in terms of their spatial extent. For example, a sphere with a finite radius is a bounded set in three-dimensional space.

## Unbounded Sets

Conversely, an unbounded set is a set that has no finite boundaries or can extend indefinitely. Such sets do not have any restrictions on their spatial extent. A line that stretches infinitely in both directions or a half-plane that extends infinitely in one direction are examples of unbounded sets.
