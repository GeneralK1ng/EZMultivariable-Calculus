# Continuity of Multivariable Functions

## Definition of Continuity

A multivariable function is said to be continuous at a point if it satisfies three conditions:

1. The function must be defined at that point.
2. The limit of the function as the input approaches that point must exist.
3. The limit of the function must be equal to the value of the function at that point.

## Formal Definition

Let's consider a multivariable function $f(x,y)$ defined on a region $R$ of the xy-plane. We say that $f(x,y)$ is continuous at a point $(a,b)$ in $R$ if the following conditions hold:

1. $f(x,y)$ is defined.
2. $\lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)}f(x,y)$ exists.
3. $\lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)}f(x,y)=f(a,b)$.

## Continuity in Open and Closed Sets

A function is said to be continuous on an open set if it is continuous at every point within that set. Similarly, a function is said to be continuous on a closed set if it is continuous at every point on the boundary of that set as well as within the set.

## Continuity in Different Variables

We can extend the concept of continuity to functions of more than two variables. A function $f(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)$ is said to be continuous at a point $(a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n)$ if the following conditions hold:

1. $(a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n)$ is defined.
2. $\lim_{(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)\to(a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n)}f(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)$ exists.
3. $\lim_{(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)\to(a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n)}f(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)=f(a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n)$.

## Determining the Existence of Limits of Multivariable Functions

 Determining the existence of limits of multivariable functions involves analyzing the behavior of the function as it approaches a particular point in its domain. Here's a step-by-step process for determining the existence of a limit for a multivariable function:

**Step 1: Define the Function** Start by defining the function that you want to analyze. Let's assume we have a function $f(x, y)$ with two variables, $x$ and $y$.

**Step 2: Select a Point** Choose a specific point $(a, b)$ in the domain of the function. This will be the point towards which you'll investigate the limit.

**Step 3: Express the Limit** Express the limit of the function $f(x, y)$ as $(x, y)$ approaches the point $(a, b)$. This can be represented as:
$$
\lim_{x,y\to(a,b)} f(x, y)
$$
**Step 4: Convert to Polar Coordinates (optional)** If the function involves trigonometric functions or exhibits circular symmetry, it may be helpful to convert the coordinates from Cartesian to polar form. This can simplify the analysis.

**Step 5: Evaluate Along Different Paths** To determine if the limit exists, evaluate the function along various paths approaching the point (a, b). These paths can include straight lines, curves, or other paths in the domain.

- Approach the point along the x-axis by setting y = b and evaluating the function as x approaches a.
- Approach the point along the y-axis by setting x = a and evaluating the function as y approaches b.
- Approach the point along a straight line by parameterizing the line equation and evaluating the function as the parameter approaches a certain value.
- Approach the point along a curve by parameterizing the curve equation and evaluating the function as the parameter approaches a certain value.

**Step 6: Analyze the Results** Examine the values obtained in Step 5. If all the paths yield the same value (i.e., a unique value), then the limit exists. In this case, the limit is equal to the common value obtained from the different paths.

If the paths yield different values or the limit does not exist along at least one path, then the limit does not exist.

### Example 1

Here's an example that demonstrates the process of determining the existence of a limit for a multivariable function:

Consider the function $f(x, y) = \frac{x^2  y}{x^4 + y^2 }$. We want to determine whether the limit of $f(x, y)$ exists as $(x, y)$ approaches the point $(0, 0)$.

**Step 1: Define the Function** $f(x, y) = \frac{x^2  y}{x^4 + y^2 }$

**Step 2: Select a Point** The point of interest is $(0, 0)$.

**Step 3: Express the Limit** We want to find the limit as $(x, y)$ approaches $(0, 0)$:
$$
\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}\frac{x^2  y}{x^4 + y^2 }
$$
**Step 4: Convert to Polar Coordinates *(optional)*** Polar coordinates conversion is not necessary for this example.

**Step 5: Evaluate Along Different Paths** Approach along the x-axis $(y = 0)$: 
$$
\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{x^2\cdot 0 }{x^4+0^2}=0
$$
Approach along the y-axis $(x = 0)$:
$$
\lim_{y\to0}\frac{0^2\cdot y}{0^4 +y^2}=0
$$
Approach along the line $y = mx$: 
$$
\lim_{x\to0}\frac{x^2\cdot(mx)}{x^4+(mx)^2}=0
$$
**Step 6: Analyze the Results** In all three cases, the limit of $f(x, y)$ as $(x, y)$ approaches $(0, 0)$ is equal to 0. Since the limit is consistent along different paths, we conclude that the limit exists and is equal to 0.

This example demonstrates that the function $f(x, y)$ approaches the value 0 as $(x, y)$ gets arbitrarily close to $(0, 0)$.

### Example 2

Here's an example where the limit of a multivariable function does not exist:

Consider the function $f(x, y) = \frac{x^2 - y^2}{x^2 + y^2}$. We want to determine whether the limit of $f(x, y)$ exists as $(x, y)$ approaches the point $(0, 0)$.

**Step 1: Define the Function** $f(x, y) = \frac{x^2 - y^2}{x^2 + y^2}$

**Step 2: Select a Point** The point of interest is $(0, 0)$.

**Step 3: Express the Limit** We want to find the limit as $(x, y)$ approaches $(0, 0)$:
$$
\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}\frac{x^2-y^2}{x^2+y^2}
$$
**Step 4: Convert to Polar Coordinates *(optional)*** Polar coordinates conversion is not necessary for this example.

**Step 5: Evaluate Along Different Paths** Approach along the x-axis (y = 0): 
$$
\lim_{x\to0}\frac{x^2-0^2}{x^2+0^2}=1
$$
Approach along the y-axis $(x = 0)$: 
$$
\lim_{y\to 0}\frac{0^2-y^2}{0^2+y^2}=-1
$$
Approach along the line $y = x$: 
$$
\lim_{x\to0}\frac{x^2-x^2}{x^2+x^2}=0
$$
**Step 6: Analyze the Results** The limits obtained from different paths are different: 1, -1, and 0. Since the limits are not consistent, we conclude that the limit of $f(x, y)$ as $(x, y)$ approaches $(0, 0)$ does not exist.

This example demonstrates that the function $f(x, y)$ does not approach a unique value as $(x, y)$ gets arbitrarily close to $(0, 0)$, indicating that the limit does not exist.

### Example 3  (**Squeeze Theorem**)

Here's an example that demonstrates the existence of a limit using the squeeze theorem (also known as the sandwich or pinching theorem) and the basic inequality:

Consider the function $f(x,y)=\frac{x^2sin(\frac{1}{y})}{x^2+y^2}$ as $(x, y)$ approaches $(0, 0)$.

**Step 1: Define the Function** $f(x,y)=\frac{x^2sin(\frac{1}{y})}{x^2+y^2}$.

**Step 2: Select a Point** The point of interest is $(0, 0)$.

**Step 3: Express the Limit** We want to find the limit as $(x, y)$ approaches $(0, 0)$:
$$
\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}\frac{x^2sin(\frac{1}{y})}{x^2+y^2}
$$
**Step 4: Convert to Polar Coordinates (optional)** Polar coordinates conversion is not necessary for this example.

**Step 5: Apply the Squeeze Theorem** To apply the squeeze theorem, we need to find two functions $g(x, y)$ and $h(x, y)$ that also approach the same limit as $(x, y)$ approaches $(0, 0)$ and satisfy the inequality $g(x, y) ≤ f(x, y) ≤ h(x, y)$.

Let's choose $g(x, y) = 0$ and $h(x, y) =\frac{x^2}{x^2+y^2}$

Now, we need to show that $\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}g(x,y)=\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}h(x,y)=0$.
$$
\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}g(x,y)=\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}0=0\\
\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}h(x,y)=\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}\frac{x^2}{x^2+y^2}=\frac{0}{0} \quad \text{(indeterminate form)}
$$


To evaluate the limit of $h(x, y)$, we can use the basic inequality: $|sin(\frac{1}{y})| ≤ 1$.

Therefore, we have: $-1 ≤ sin(\frac{1}{y}) ≤ 1$.

Multiplying through by $x^2$ gives: $-x^2 ≤ x^2 \cdot sin(\frac{1}{y}) ≤ x^2$.

Using this inequality, we can rewrite $h(x, y)$ as: $\frac{-x^2}{(x^2 + y^2)} ≤ x^2 \cdot \frac{sin(\frac{1}{y})}{x^2 + y^2} ≤ \frac{x^2}{x^2 + y^2}$.

Now, as $(x, y)$ approaches $(0, 0)$, both $\frac{-x^2}{x^2 + y^2}$ and $\frac{x^2}{x^2 + y^2}$ approach 0.

By the squeeze theorem, since $\frac{-x^2}{x^2 + y^2} ≤ f(x, y) ≤ \frac{x^2}{x^2 + y^2}$, and both lower and upper bounds approach $0$, we can conclude that:
$$
\lim_{(x,y)\to (0,0)}f(x,y)=0
$$
**Step 6: Analyze the Results** According to the application of the squeeze theorem, the limit of $f(x, y)$ as $(x, y)$ approaches $(0, 0)$ is equal to $0$. The squeeze theorem allowed us to determine the limit by finding suitable upper and lower bounds that approached the same limit as the function.

This example demonstrates that the function $f(x, y)$ approaches the value $0$ as $(x, y)$ gets arbitrarily close to $(0, 0)$ using the squeeze theorem and the basic inequality.

## Relationship between the Existence of Limits and Continuity of Multivariable Functions

In the study of multivariable calculus, the existence of limits plays a fundamental role in determining the continuity of multivariable functions. The concept of continuity is closely related to the behavior of a function as it approaches a particular point in its domain. Here's how the existence of limits and continuity are connected:

**1. Existence of Limits** 

The existence of a limit for a multivariable function at a specific point $(a, b)$ indicates the behavior of the function as it approaches that point. If the limit exists, it means that the function approaches a unique value as the independent variables approach the given point. This implies that there is a well-defined value that the function "approaches" as we get arbitrarily close to the specified point.

**2. Continuity of Multivariable Functions** 

Continuity is a property that describes the smooth and uninterrupted behavior of a function. A multivariable function is said to be continuous at a point $(a, b)$ if three conditions are satisfied:

- The function is defined at the point $(a, b)$.
- The limit of the function exists at $(a, b)$.
- The value of the function at $(a, b)$ is equal to the limit.

In other words, a multivariable function is continuous if it does not exhibit any abrupt changes, jumps, or gaps in its behavior. It implies that as we approach a specific point, both the function's value and its limit are the same.

**3. Relationship between Existence of Limits and Continuity** 

The existence of a limit at a point is a necessary condition for continuity. If the limit of a multivariable function exists at a point $(a, b)$, then the function can potentially be continuous at that point. However, it's important to note that the existence of limits alone does not guarantee continuity. The function must satisfy additional conditions to ensure continuity, such as being defined at the point and having its value equal to the limit.

Conversely, if the limit does not exist at a point, the function cannot be continuous at that point. If the function approaches different values or exhibits oscillatory behavior as we approach the point, it indicates a lack of continuity.

In summary, the existence of limits provides valuable information about the behavior of a multivariable function as it approaches a point, and it serves as a foundation for analyzing the continuity of the function. A function is continuous at a point if and only if the limit exists, the function is defined at the point, and the value of the function matches the limit.
