# Derivatives of Multivariable Complex Functions

In multivariable calculus, the concept of composite functions extends to functions with multiple variables. The derivatives of multivariable composite functions involve the chain rule, which enables us to find the rate of change of a composite function with respect to its variables.

## Composite Functions

A composite function is formed by applying one function to the output of another function. In the context of multivariable calculus, we have functions with multiple variables. Let's consider two functions:

- $f(x,y)$: A function of variables $x$ and $y$.
- $g(u,v)$: A function of variables $u$ and $v$.

Now, if we define a new function $h(x,y)=g(f(x,y))$, we have a composite function. It means that we apply $f$ as an input to $g$.

## Chain Rule

To find the derivative of the composite function $h(x,y)$, we use the chain rule, which states:
$$
\frac{\part h}{dx}=\frac{dh}{du}\cdot\frac{du}{dx}+\frac{dh}{dv}\cdot\frac{dv}{dx}
$$
This rule tells us that the derivative of a composite function is the sum of the products of the derivatives of the inner and outer functions.
