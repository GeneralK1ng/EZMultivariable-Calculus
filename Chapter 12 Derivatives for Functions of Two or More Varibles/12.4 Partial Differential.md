# 12.4 Partial Differentiation

## Introduction

In multivariable calculus, partial differentiation is a technique used to compute the rate of change of a function with respect to one of its variables while holding the other variables constant. It allows us to analyze how a function changes along specific directions in a multi-dimensional space.

 Let's start with the definition of a derivative in the context of single-variable calculus and then introduce the concept of partial derivatives in multivariable calculus.

## Derivative in Single-Variable Calculus

In single-variable calculus, the derivative measures the rate at which a function changes with respect to its independent variable. Let's consider a function $f(x)$.

The derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to x, denoted as $f'(x) \quad \text{or}\quad dy/dx$, is defined as the limit of the difference quotient as the change in x approaches zero:
$$
f'(x)=\lim_{\Delta x\to0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}
$$
This derivative represents the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $f(x)$ at a given point.

## Partial Derivatives in Multivariable Calculus

In multivariable calculus, we extend the concept of derivatives to functions with multiple variables. Suppose we have a function $f(x, y)$ that depends on two variables, $x$ and $y$.

The partial derivative of $f(x, y)$ with respect to $x$, denoted as $∂f/∂x$, represents the rate of change of $f$ with respect to $x$ while keeping $y$ constant. It is defined as:
$$
\frac{\part f}{\part x}\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x,y)-f(x,y)}{\Delta x}
$$
Similarly, the partial derivative of $f(x, y)$ with respect to $y$, denoted as $∂f/∂y$, represents the rate of change of $f$ with respect to $y$ while keeping $x$ constant. It is defined as:
$$
\frac{\part f}{\part y}\lim_{\Delta y\to 0}\frac{f(x,y+ \Delta y)-f(x,y)}{\Delta y}
$$
Partial derivatives allow us to examine how a function changes with respect to individual variables while holding the other variables constant.

## Notation

Partial derivatives are denoted using the $∂$ (partial derivative) symbol. The partial derivative of a function $f(x, y)$ with respect to x is written as $∂f/∂x$ or $∂x f$.

## First-Order Partial Derivatives

The first-order partial derivative measures the rate of change of a function with respect to one variable while treating all other variables as constants.

### Example

Consider the function $f(x, y) = x^2 + 3xy + y^2$. To find the first-order partial derivative with respect to $x$, we differentiate $f(x, y)$ with respect to x while treating y as a constant:
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(x^2+3xy+y^2)=2x+3y
$$
Similarly, to find the first-order partial derivative with respect to y, we differentiate $f(x, y)$ with respect to $y$ while treating $x$ as a constant:
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial}{\partial y}(x^2+3xy+y^2)=3x+2y
$$

## Higher-Order Partial Derivatives

Higher-order partial derivatives are obtained by differentiating the function successively. The second-order partial derivative measures the rate of change of the first-order partial derivative with respect to a particular variable.

### Example

Using the function $f(x, y) = x^2 + 3xy + y^2$, we can find the second-order partial derivatives:

To find the second-order partial derivative with respect to x and y, we differentiate $∂f/∂x$ with respect to $y$:
$$
\frac{\part^2f}{\part y \part x}=\frac{\part}{\part y}(2x+3y)=3
$$
To find the second-order partial derivative with respect to $y$ and $x$, we differentiate $∂f/∂y$ with respect to $x$:
$$
\frac{\part^2f}{\part x \part y}=\frac{\part}{\part x}(2x+3y)=2
$$

## Mixed Partial Derivatives

Mixed partial derivatives are obtained by taking the partial derivative with respect to one variable and then with respect to another variable, in any order.

### Example

Consider the function $f(x, y) = x^3y^2$. We can compute the following mixed partial derivatives:

First, let's calculate $∂f/∂x$:
$$
\frac{\part f}{\part x}=\frac{\part}{\part x}(x^3y^2)=3x^3y^2
$$
Next, let's calculate $∂^2f/(∂y∂x)$, which involves taking the partial derivative with respect to $y$ first, and then with respect to $x$:
$$
\frac{\part^2f}{\part y \part x}=\frac{\part}{\part y}(\frac{\part f}{\part x})=\frac{\part}{\part y}(3x^2y^2)=6x^2y
$$
Similarly, let's calculate $∂^2f/(∂x∂y)$, which involves taking the partial derivative with respect to $x$ first, and then with respect to $y$:
$$
\frac{\part^2f}{\part x \part y}=\frac{\part}{\part x}(\frac{\part f}{\part y})=\frac{\part}{\part x}(2x^3y)=6x^2y
$$
We can observe that $∂^2f/(∂y∂x)$ and $∂^2f/(∂x∂y)$ yield the same result, which is consistent with Clairaut's theorem.

## Clairaut's Theorem

Clairaut's theorem, also known as the equality of mixed partial derivatives, states that if a function has **continuous** second-order partial derivatives, then the order in which you take the mixed partial derivatives does not matter. In other words, the mixed partial derivatives are equal.

Mathematically, for a function $f(x, y)$ with continuous second-order partial derivatives, **Clairaut's theorem** can be stated as:
$$
\frac{\part^2f}{\part y \part x}=\frac{\part^2f}{\part x \part y}
$$
This theorem implies that if the function has continuous second-order partial derivatives, the value of the mixed partial derivative is independent of the order in which you take the derivatives.

Clairaut's theorem is significant because it simplifies the process of calculating mixed partial derivatives. Instead of computing both $∂^2f/(∂y∂x)$ and $∂^2f/(∂x∂y)$, you can calculate only one of them and know that they will be equal.

The theorem is named after the French mathematician Alexis Clairaut, who first formulated this result in the 18th century. It has wide-ranging applications in various branches of mathematics, physics, and engineering, particularly in areas where multiple variables are involved.

Understanding and utilizing Clairaut's theorem can greatly simplify calculations involving mixed partial derivatives and provide insights into the symmetry and behavior of functions.
