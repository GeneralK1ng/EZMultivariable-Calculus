# 12.1 Functions of Two or More Variables

We have already had a first glimpse into the mystery of space by learning about vectors, and then we are going to get a more mathematical understanding of the various variations in space through functions.

But don't think it's hard, in this section we'll just get to know how to describe things in space by functions.

## Introduction

In single variable calculus, we dealt with functions that had only one input and one output. In multivariable calculus, we extend this idea to functions that take two or more inputs and give one or more outputs. We call these functions "multivariable functions" or "functions of several variables." They are essential in many fields, including physics, engineering, economics, and biology.

## Domain and Range

The domain of a multivariable function is the set of all possible input values. For a function of two variables, it is usually denoted by $D\subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$. For example, $D = {(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2 : x^2 + y^2 \leq 1}$ is the disk of radius 1 centered at the origin.

The range of a multivariable function is the set of all possible output values. For example, if $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$, then the range is $R={z\in\mathbb{R}:z\geq 0}$.

## Graphs and Level Sets

In single variable calculus, we can graph a function by plotting points of the form $(x,f(x))$. In multivariable calculus, we can still plot a function, but we need a three-dimensional graph because there are two input variables and one output variable. For example, the graph of $z = f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$ is the paraboloid shown below.

Level sets are another useful tool for visualizing multivariable functions. A level set of a function is the set of all points in the domain that have the same output value. For example, if $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$, then the level sets are circles centered at the origin, as shown below.

## Applications of Contour Plots

Contour plots are a powerful tool for visualizing multivariable functions. They provide a way to represent the level sets of a function in a two-dimensional plot. In a contour plot, each contour line represents a level set of the function, and the values of the function are indicated by different colors or shading.

### Construction of Contour Plots

To construct a contour plot, we first choose a set of output values, say $c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_k$. Then, we find the level sets of the function $f(x,y)$ corresponding to each of these output values. That is, we find the sets of points $(x,y)$ such that $f(x,y)=c_i$ for $i=1,2,\ldots,k$. These sets of points are the contour lines.

To visualize the contour plot, we can assign a different color or shade to each contour line, depending on the corresponding output value $c_i$. For example, we can use a color map where lighter colors correspond to lower values and darker colors correspond to higher values.

### Properties of Contour Plots

Contour plots have several useful properties that make them a valuable tool in multivariable calculus.

1. Contour plots can reveal the shape and features of a function that are not apparent from a three-dimensional graph.
2. Contour plots can show the direction and magnitude of the gradient vector of a function. The gradient vector of a function at a point $(x,y)$ points in the direction of the steepest increase of the function, and its magnitude gives the rate of increase. In a contour plot, the gradient vector is perpendicular to the contour line and its magnitude is indicated by the spacing between adjacent contour lines.
3. Contour plots can be used to visualize the behavior of a function in different regions of the domain. For example, if a function has several local maxima or minima, these will be indicated by closed contours in the contour plot.

### Example

- You can determine the steepness of a terrain based on the sparseness of the contour lines. The denser the contour line, the steeper the slope, and the sparser the contour line, the slower the slope. For example, if you're climbing a mountain, you might choose a route with sparse contours because it's easier to walk, rather than a route with dense contours because it's steeper and more dangerous.
- You can determine the type of terrain based on the change in the value of the contour lines. The contour line value decreases from the center to all around, which means mountainous or hilly; the contour line value increases from the center to all around, which means basin. For example, if you are looking for a scenic place to visit, you might choose a mountainous or hilly area because of its diverse landforms such as peaks, valleys, saddles, canyons, etc.; and not a basin area because it is flatter and more monotonous.
- You can determine the flow direction and hydrological characteristics of a river based on the relationship between the contour lines and the river. The contour line intersects the river vertically, and the contour line bends upstream as it crosses the river valley, making a "V" shape. For example, if you are boating or fishing, you might choose a valley with a dense contour line because it has a high river velocity, plenty of water, and sometimes a waterfall, rather than a valley with a sparse contour line because it has a slow flow, little water, and dries up easily.
- You can make reasonable planning and layout according to the role of contour lines in production practice. For example:
  - If you want to build a reservoir, you should choose to build a dam at the narrowest point at the exit of a river gorge where the contour lines are dense, and the reservoir area should be chosen in a river valley, valley or depression, or small basin. This will increase the reservoir capacity, the use of water energy, and prevent flooding.
  - If you want to build a port, you should choose to build a port in a bay area with sparse contours and dense isobaths, avoiding rivers with large sand content. This will ensure that the harbor is wide and deep, sheltered from wind and waves, and has smooth navigation.
  - If you want to build an industrial zone, you should choose to build a factory in an area with flat and open terrain with large contour intervals and convenient transportation, sufficient water and close to resources, avoiding basin terrain. This will save land, reduce costs and pollution.
  - If you want to build an agricultural area, you should propose the layout plan of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery according to the type of landforms reflected by contour lines, such as undulating terrain and steep slope, combined with climate and water conditions, according to local conditions.
