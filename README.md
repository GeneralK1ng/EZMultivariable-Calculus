# EZMultivariable-Calculus
Welcome to the comprehensive multi-variable calculus notes repository specifically designed for students taking MTH004 and MTH008 at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. Created by a first-year student in the ICS program, these notes are aimed at helping students enhance their understanding and mastery of key concepts in calculus.

The notes provide clear and concise explanations, accompanied by well-designed charts and illustrations. All visualizations have been created using scientific computing libraries in MATLAB and Python, and the corresponding code snippets are provided for reference and further exploration.

Targeting both beginners and students at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, this repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning calculus. Whether you are just starting your calculus journey or seeking a comprehensive review, these notes will guide you through the intricacies of multi-variable calculus.

While these notes have been meticulously compiled, the understanding that imperfections may exist is acknowledged. Therefore, contributions from individuals capable and willing to refine the notes are warmly welcomed. Together, we can improve and refine this invaluable resource for the benefit of the broader academic community.

Please note that the initial release of these notes is in English, with plans to gradually introduce a Chinese version in future updates.

As the author, a first-year student in the ICS program at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, I am excited to share this educational material and encourage you to embark on your multi-variable calculus journey with these comprehensive notes.
