# EZMultivariable-Calculus
Welcome to the comprehensive multi-variable calculus notes repository specifically designed for students taking MTH004 and MTH008 at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. Created by a first-year student in the ICS program, these notes are aimed at helping students enhance their understanding and mastery of key concepts in calculus.

The notes provide clear and concise explanations, accompanied by well-designed charts and illustrations. All visualizations have been created using scientific computing libraries in MATLAB and Python, and the corresponding code snippets are provided for reference and further exploration.

Targeting both beginners and students at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, this repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning calculus. Whether you are just starting your calculus journey or seeking a comprehensive review, these notes will guide you through the intricacies of multi-variable calculus.

While these notes have been meticulously compiled, the understanding that imperfections may exist is acknowledged. Therefore, contributions from individuals capable and willing to refine the notes are warmly welcomed. Together, we can improve and refine this invaluable resource for the benefit of the broader academic community.

Please note that the initial release of these notes is in English, with plans to gradually introduce a Chinese version in future updates.

As the author, a first-year student in the ICS program at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, I am excited to share this educational material and encourage you to embark on your multi-variable calculus journey with these comprehensive notes.

# Multi-Variable Calculus Notes
I am very pleased to share with you these notes on multivariable calculus, a personal study resource that I have put together to help you get a better grasp of this important and interesting (nope) subject.

Multivariable calculus is a key subject in mathematics, exploring the properties of functions of many variables, the geometry of curves and surfaces, and their application to real-world problems. For you, mastering multivariable calculus is not only an important part of your academic development, it is also one of the most difficult mathematics courses you will experience in your first year at XJTLU ().

However, learning multivariable calculus is not always an easy task. In the process, we often encounter various challenges and confusions. Therefore, I hope that this note will be a useful aid to your studies, providing you with clear and systematic explanations of concepts, detailed calculation steps and answers to some frequently asked questions. I have made every effort to ensure that the notes are accurate and easy to understand, but due to personal editing, there are inevitably some gaps and errors. I therefore welcome any questions or valuable suggestions you may have to help me improve and refine this study material.

It is important to remember that multivariable calculus is a subject that requires hands-on practice. In addition to theoretical knowledge, it is more important to consolidate what you have learnt through a lot of practice and application to practical problems. I hope that these notes will stimulate your thinking and desire to explore, and help you to develop your problem-solving skills.

As I am a student of MTH004, I may not be able to cover all the students in each course, so if you would like to add to this, you are more than welcome to do so!

Finally, I would like to express my sincere wishes to you. I hope that these notes on multivariable calculus will be a good friend to you on your learning journey and help you to overcome your difficulties and achieve excellent results. Whether you are beginners or students who have already acquired some knowledge, I am sure that this note will provide you with something of value. May your progress in the world of multivariable calculus be unhindered.

May your studies be fruitful!

With my sincere regards.
