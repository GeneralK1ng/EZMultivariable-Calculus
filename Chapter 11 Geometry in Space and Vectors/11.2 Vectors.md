# 11.2 Vectors

In mathematics, a vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. Vectors can be represented geometrically by directed line segments, with the length of the line segment representing the magnitude of the vector, and the direction of the line segment representing the direction of the vector.

There are several concepts and terminology involved when working with vectors, including:

- Magnitude: The magnitude of a vector is its length or size. It is denoted by $||v||$ or $|v|$, and is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: $||v|| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + ... + v_n^2}$, where $v_1, v_2, ..., v_n$ are the components of the vector.
- Direction: The direction of a vector is given by the angle it makes with a reference axis or plane. Vectors in two dimensions have a direction angle, while vectors in three dimensions have a direction cosine or direction ratios.
- Components: A vector can be represented in terms of its components, which are the projections of the vector onto the coordinate axes. In two dimensions, a vector is represented as $(x,y)$, while in three dimensions it is represented as$ (x,y,z)$.
- Unit vectors: A unit vector is a vector of magnitude 1 that points in the same direction as a given vector. It is denoted by a hat (^) on top of the vector symbol, such as $\hat{v}$.
- Dot product: The dot product of two vectors is a scalar quantity that measures the similarity of their directions. It is denoted by v · w, and is calculated using the formula: $v · w = v_1w_1 + v_2w_2 + ... + v_nw_n$.
- Cross product: The cross product of two vectors is a vector that is perpendicular to both of the input vectors. It is denoted by $v × w$, and is calculated using the formula: $v × w = <v_2w_3 - v_3w_2, v_3w_1 - v_1w_3, v_1w_2 - v_2w_1>$.

Vectors are used in many areas of mathematics and science, including physics, engineering, and computer graphics. They are particularly useful for describing physical quantities such as force, velocity, and acceleration, which have both magnitude and direction.

This is also just some basic concepts, and I believe you should have no problem asking me questions, so let's start formally studying the chapter on vectors.

## Operations on Vectors

1. Vector addition and subtraction: To add two vectors, we simply add their corresponding components. For example, if $v = <v_1, v_2, v_3> $and $w = <w_1, w_2, w_3>$, then $v + w = <v_1+w_1, v_2+w_2, v_3+w_3>$. To subtract one vector from another, we can simply add the negative of the second vector to the first. For example, $v - w = v + (-w)$.

   > The geometric meaning of vector addition is that it represents the displacement resulting from the sequential application of two or more individual displacements. For example, if we start at point $A$ and then travel along vector $v$ to reach point $ B$, and then travel along vector $w$ to reach point $C$, the displacement from $A$ to $C$ is given by the vector$ v + w$.
   >
   > The geometric meaning of vector subtraction is that it represents the displacement required to get from the end point of one vector to the end point of another vector, when the start point of the second vector coincides with the end point of the first vector. For example, if we start at point A and then travel along vector $v$ to reach point $B$, and then travel along vector w to reach point $C$, the displacement from $B$ to $C$ is given by the vector $w - v$.

2. Scalar multiplication: We can multiply a vector by a scalar (a real number). This operation scales the vector by the magnitude of the scalar, and changes its direction if the scalar is negative. For example, if $v = <v1, v2, v3> $and c is a scalar, then $cv = <cv_1, cv_2, cv_3>$.

   > Scalar multiplication involves multiplying a vector by a scalar (a real number), which results in either stretching or shrinking the vector, depending on the sign and magnitude of the scalar. If the scalar is positive, the vector gets stretched in the same direction. If the scalar is negative, the vector gets flipped in the opposite direction, and if the scalar is zero, the vector collapses to the origin.

3. Dot product: The dot product measures the similarity of the directions of two vectors. It is defined as v · w = v1w1 + v2w2 + v3w3. Geometrically, it is equal to the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors and the cosine of the angle between them. One useful application of the dot product is finding the angle between two vectors, which can be calculated using the formula $cos\theta = \frac{(v · w) }{(||v|| ||w||)} $.

   > The dot product, also known as the inner product, is a scalar quantity that measures the projection of one vector onto another. The geometric meaning of the dot product is that it gives the cosine of the angle between the two vectors, multiplied by their lengths. For example, if we have two vectors v and w, their dot product is defined as $v \cdot w = |v||w|cos\theta$, where |v| and |w| are the lengths of the vectors, and theta is the angle between them.

4. Cross product: The cross product of two vectors is a vector that is perpendicular to both of the input vectors. Its magnitude is equal to the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors and the sine of the angle between them. Geometrically, the cross product can be visualized as the area of the parallelogram formed by the two input vectors. The direction of the cross product can be determined using the right-hand rule.

   > Finally, the cross product, also known as the outer product, is a vector quantity that measures the area of the parallelogram formed by two vectors. The geometric meaning of the cross product is that it gives a vector that is perpendicular to both of the input vectors, and whose direction follows the right-hand rule. For example, if we have two vectors $v$ and $w$, their cross product is defined as $v \times w = |v||w|sin\theta n$, where $|v| $and $|w|$ are the lengths of the vectors, theta is the angle between them, and n is a unit vector perpendicular to the plane defined by $v$ and $w$.

5. Unit vectors: A unit vector is a vector of magnitude 1 that points in the same direction as a given vector. We can find a unit vector in the direction of a given vector by dividing the vector by its magnitude. For example, if $v = <v_1, v_2, v_3>$, then the unit vector in the direction of v is given by $u = \frac{v}{||v||}$.



The standard unit vectors are usually denoted by $i$,$ j$, and $k$ and are defined as vectors that have a magnitude of one and point in the positive $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively. These vectors are used to construct any other vector in three-dimensional space.

Given a vector v with components $(v1, v2, v3)$, we can represent it in terms of its components and standard unit vectors as follows:
$$
v = v_1 i + v_2 j + v_3 k
$$
Here, $v_1$,$ v_2$, and $v_3$ are the scalar coefficients that represent the magnitude of the vector along each of the three axes. The standard unit vectors $i$, $j$, and $k$ represent the direction of the vector along each of the axes.

To add or subtract vectors, we can simply add or subtract their corresponding components. For example, if we have two vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ with components $(v_1x, v_1y, v_1z)$ and $(v_2x, v_2y, v_2z)$, respectively, then their sum is given by:
$$
v_1 + v_2 = (v_1x + v_2x) i + (v_1y + v_2y) j + (v_1z + v_2z) k
$$
Similarly, their difference is given by:
$$
v_1 - v_2 = (v_1x - v_2x) i + (v_1y - v_2y) j + (v_1z - v_2z) k
$$
To find the magnitude of a vector, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. For a vector v with components $(v1, v2, v3)$, its magnitude is given by:
$$
||v|| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + v_3^2}
$$
To find the unit vector in the same direction as a given vector v, we can divide the vector by its magnitude:
$$
u = \frac{v}{||v||} 
$$
where u is the unit vector in the direction of $v$.

To find the dot product of two vectors $u$ and $v$, we multiply their corresponding components and then add up the results. Mathematically, the dot product of $u$ and $v$ is given by:
$$
u · v = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + u_3v_3
$$
where $u_1$, $u_2$, $u_3$ and $v_1$,$ v_2$,$ v_3$ are the components of $u$ and $v$, respectively.

The dot product is a useful tool for finding the angle between two vectors. If $u$ and $v$ are two vectors, then the angle between them, denoted by $θ$, is given by:
$$
cosθ = \frac {(u · v)}{(||u|| \cdot ||v||)}
$$
To find the cross product of two vectors $u$ and $v$, we first write them as 3-dimensional vectors and then use the determinant to calculate their cross product. Mathematically, the cross product of $u$ and $v$ is given by:
$$
u × v = (u_2v_3 - u_3v_2) i - (u_1v_3 - u_3v_1) j + (u_1v_2 - u_2v_1) k
$$
The cross product is useful for finding the area of a parallelogram formed by two vectors and the volume of a parallelepiped formed by three vectors.

In summary, an algebraic approach to vectors involves representing vectors in terms of their components using standard unit vectors or basis vectors. To add, subtract, find the magnitude, and the unit vector of a vector, we use to add, subtract, find the magnitude, and the unit vector of a vector, we use scalar multiplication, and vector addition/subtraction. To find the dot product of two vectors, we use their components and add them up. To find the cross product of two vectors, we use the determinant of their components.

When solving problems involving vectors, it is important to keep in mind the properties of vectors, such as commutativity and distributivity, and to use algebraic techniques to simplify expressions. Some useful techniques for solving problems involving vectors are:

1. Decomposing vectors: Sometimes, it is useful to decompose a vector into its components along different axes or planes. For example, if a vector $v$ makes an angle $θ$ with the x-axis, then its components along the $x$ and $y$ axes are given by v $cos(θ)$ and $v$ $sin(θ)$, respectively.
2. Projection: The projection of a vector $u$ onto another vector $v$ is the component of $u$ that lies along the direction of $v$. The projection of $u$ onto $v$ is given by:

$$
proj_v(u) = \frac{\vec{u} · \vec{v} }{||\vec{v}||^2} \vec{v}
$$

3. Vector equations: Vector equations can be used to solve systems of equations involving vectors. For example, if we have two vectors u and v, and we know that their sum is equal to another vector w, we can write:

$$
u + v = w
$$

​	   and then solve for either u or v in terms of the other two vectors.

4. Geometric interpretations: Geometric interpretations of vectors can be helpful in visualizing and understanding the problem at hand. For example, the dot product of two vectors can be interpreted as the product of the magnitudes of the vectors and the cosine of the angle between them, while the cross product can be interpreted as the area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors.

Overall, an algebraic approach to vectors involves representing vectors in terms of their components using standard unit vectors or basis vectors and using algebraic techniques to simplify expressions and solve problems. It is important to keep in mind the properties of vectors and to use geometric interpretations to gain insight into the problem.
