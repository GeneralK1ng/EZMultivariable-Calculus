# 11.6 Lines and Tangent Lines in Three-Space

## Direction Vectors

In multivariable calculus, we often work with vectors in three-dimensional space (also called "three-space" or "3D space"). One important concept is the direction vector of a line in three-space.

A direction vector is simply a vector that points in the direction of the line. Any nonzero vector parallel to the line can be used as a direction vector. For example, consider the line that passes through the points `(1,2,3)` and `(4,5,6)` in three-space. One possible direction vector for this line is the vector from the first point to the second point:
$$
<4-1, 5-2, 6-3> = <3, 3, 3>
$$
This vector is parallel to the line, since it points in the same direction as the line. However, it is not the only direction vector we could choose - any nonzero scalar multiple of this vector (such as `<6, 6, 6>` or `<-1, -1, -1>`) would also be a valid direction vector.

## Parametric Equations of a Line

Once we have a direction vector for a line in three-space, we can use it to write the parametric equations of the line. The parametric equations give the coordinates of any point on the line in terms of a parameter (usually denoted by `t`).

Suppose we have a line that passes through the point `P = (x0, y0, z0)` and has a direction vector `v = <a, b, c>`. Then the parametric equations of the line are:
$$
x = x_0 + at
$$

$$
y = y_0 + bt
$$

$$
z = z_0 + ct
$$

These equations give the coordinates `(x,y,z)` of any point on the line in terms of the parameter `t`. For example, if `t=0`, we get the point `P`; if `t=1`, we get a point one unit away from `P` in the direction of `v`; if `t=-1`, we get a point one unit away from `P` in the opposite direction of `v`, and so on.



## Tangent Lines and Normal Vectors

Another important concept in multivariable calculus is the tangent line to a curve in three-space. Given a curve (which can be thought of as a set of points in three-space), the tangent line at a particular point on the curve is the line that "best approximates" the curve at that point.

One way to find the tangent line is to use the parametric equations of the curve. Suppose we have a curve with parametric equations $x = f(t)$, $y = g(t)$, and $z = h(t)$. If we want to find the tangent line at the point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ on the curve (where $x_0 = f(t_0), y_0 = g(t_0), z_0 = h(t_0)$), we can use the following procedure:

1. Compute the first derivatives of `f`, `g`, and `h` with respect to `t`, evaluated at `t=t0`. These derivatives give the direction of the tangent vector to the curve at the point `(x0, y0, z0)`.
2. Write the parametric equations of the tangent line using the point `(x0, y0, z0)` and the tangent vector from step 1.

The direction of the tangent vector gives us some more information about the behavior of the curve at the point `(x0, y0, z0)`. If the tangent vector points in the same direction as the curve is "moving" at that point, we say the curve is "going up" or "going to the right" (depending on which coordinate is increasing). If the tangent vector points in the opposite direction, we say the curve is "going down" or "going to the left".

We can also use the tangent vector to find another important vector associated with the curve: the normal vector. The normal vector is perpendicular to the tangent vector and points "outward" from the curve. We can find the normal vector by taking the cross product of the tangent vector with any other vector that is not parallel to the tangent vector.

## Symmetric equations

### Introduction

Symmetric equations are a way of representing a line or plane in three-dimensional space using equations that are symmetric in x, y, and z. These equations can be useful for finding the intersection of two or more lines or planes, or for determining whether a given point lies on a given line or plane.

### Equations for lines

The symmetric equations for a line in three-dimensional space are:
$$
\frac{x - x_0}{a} = \frac{y - y_0}{b} = \frac{z - z_0}{c}
$$
where `(x0, y0, z0)` is a point on the line and `(a, b, c)` is a direction vector for the line. These equations can also be written as:
$$
x = x_0 + at
$$

$$
y = y_0 + bt
$$

$$
z = z_0 + ct
$$

where `t` is a parameter that ranges over all real numbers. These equations give the coordinates of any point on the line in terms of the parameter `t`.

We can also use the symmetric equations to find the direction vector of a line given two points on the line. Suppose we have two points `(x1, y1, z1)` and `(x2, y2, z2)` on the line. Then the direction vector `(a, b, c)` is given by:
$$
a=x_2 - x_1
$$

$$
b=y_2-y_1
$$

$$
c=z_2 - z_3
$$

### Equations for planes

The symmetric equations for a plane in three-dimensional space are:
$$
\frac{x - x_0}{a} = \frac{y - y_0}{b} = \frac{z - z_0}{c}
$$
where `(x0, y0, z0)` is a point on the plane and `(a, b, c)` is a normal vector to the plane. These equations can also be written as:
$$
ax + by + cz = d
$$
where $d = ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0$. This form of the equation is sometimes called the "general form" of the equation for a plane.

We can also use the symmetric equations to find the normal vector of a plane given three points on the plane. Suppose we have three non-collinear points $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$, $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$, and $(x_3, y_3, z_3)$ on the plane. Then two vectors in the plane are:
$$
u = <x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1, z_2 - z_1>
$$

$$
v = <x_3 - x_1, y_3 - y_1, z_3 - z_1>
$$

and the normal vector $(a, b, c)$ is given by:
$$
a = u_2v_3 - u_3v_2
$$

$$
b = u_3v_1 - u_1v_3
$$

$$
c = u_1v_2 - u_2v_1
$$

where $u_i$ and $v_i$ denote the components of vectors $u$ and $v$ respectively.
