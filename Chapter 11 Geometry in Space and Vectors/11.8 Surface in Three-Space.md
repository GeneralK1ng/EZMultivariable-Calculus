# 11.8 Surface in Three-Space

Cross sections and traces are two ways of looking at the shapes of 3D objects by cutting them with a plane. A plane is a flat surface that extends infinitely in all directions. Imagine you have a loaf of bread and a knife. You can cut the bread in different ways to get different shapes of slices. Those slices are called cross sections of the bread. For example, if you cut the bread horizontally, you get a rectangular cross section. If you cut it diagonally, you get a trapezoidal cross section. If you cut it vertically, you get a square cross section.

A trace is similar to a cross section, but instead of cutting the object, you just look at where the plane touches the object. For example, if you have a cone and a plane that is parallel to the base of the cone, the trace of the plane on the cone is a circle. If you have a sphere and a plane that goes through the center of the sphere, the trace of the plane on the sphere is a circle too.

Cross sections and traces can help us understand the properties and structures of 3D objects better. They can also help us create 2D drawings of 3D objects by projecting them onto a plane. For example, if you want to draw a cube on a piece of paper, you can use cross sections and traces to find out what shapes you need to draw and how they are connected.

## Cross sections and traces

Before diving into surfaces, it's important to understand the concepts of cross sections and traces, which will be used to describe surfaces in three-space.

A **cross section** is the intersection of a three-dimensional object with a plane. For example, if you cut a cylinder with a plane that is perpendicular to the base, the resulting cross section is a circle.

A **trace** is the intersection of a surface with a plane that is parallel to one of the coordinate planes (i.e. the $xy$, $xz$, or $yz$ plane). For example, if you have a surface that is defined by the equation $z = x^2 + y^2$, the trace in the $xy$ plane (i.e. when $z=0$) is the circle $x^2 + y^2 = 0$.

## Surfaces in three-space

A **surface** in three-space is a two-dimensional object that exists in three-dimensional space. In other words, a surface is a collection of points that can be described by two parameters, usually denoted by $u$ and $v$. The parameters $u$ and $v$ can be thought of as coordinates on the surface, much like $x$ and $y$ are coordinates on a plane.

There are many ways to represent a surface in three-space, but one common way is to use a **parametric representation**. A parametric representation of a surface specifies the coordinates of each point on the surface as a function of the parameters $u$ and $v$.

For example, consider the surface given by the parametric equations:
$$
x=u
$$

$$
y=v
$$

$$
z=u^2+v^2
$$

This surface is a paraboloid that opens upward. The $u$ and $v$ parameters can take on any values, so this surface extends infinitely in all directions.

Another way to represent a surface is to use an **implicit representation**. An implicit representation of a surface is an equation that describes all the points on the surface. For example, the equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$ is an implicit representation of a sphere with radius 1 centered at the origin.



## Tangent planes and normal vectors

Just like a plane in two-dimensional space can be described by a point and a normal vector, a surface in three-space can be described by a point on the surface and a **normal vector**. The normal vector is perpendicular to the surface at the point, and it can be used to define the **tangent plane** to the surface at the point.

After we learn the next chapter we can directly find the equation of the tangent plane inside the surface, but so far we have not learned enough to find it. Therefore, it is important to understand this concept first, and then we can go back to this point after we have learned the powerful tool of partial derivatives.

## Some common 3D geometries

### Cylinders

A cylinder is a surface that consists of all the points that are a fixed distance from a given line called the axis of the cylinder. There are two types of cylinders: circular and elliptical.

#### Circular cylinder

A circular cylinder is a surface that consists of all the points that are a fixed distance from a given line called the axis of the cylinder, and the cross section perpendicular to the axis is a circle. The equation of a circular cylinder with axis along the z-axis and radius r is:
$$
x^2+y^2=r^2
$$

#### Elliptical cylinder

An elliptical cylinder is a surface that consists of all the points that are a fixed distance from a given line called the axis of the cylinder, and the cross section perpendicular to the axis is an ellipse. The equation of an elliptical cylinder with axis along the z-axis, and radii a and b in the x and y directions, respectively, is:
$$
\frac{x^2}{a^2} +\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1
$$

### Quadric Surfaces

A quadric surface is a second-degree surface in three-dimensional space. It is defined by a quadratic equation in three variables x, y, and z. There are several types of quadric surfaces:

#### Sphere

A sphere is a quadric surface that consists of all the points that are a fixed distance from a given point called the center of the sphere. The equation of a sphere with center at (h,k,l) and radius r is:
$$
(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2+(z-l)^2=r^2
$$

#### Ellipsoid

An ellipsoid is a quadric surface that is similar to a sphere, but its shape is determined by three different radii. The equation of an ellipsoid with center at (h,k,l) and radii a, b, and c in the x, y, and z directions, respectively, is:
$$
\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2}+\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2}+\frac{(z-l)^2}{c^2}=1
$$

#### Hyperboloid of one sheet

A hyperboloid of one sheet is a quadric surface that consists of two mirror-image sheets, each of which is hyperboloid in shape. The equation of a hyperboloid of one sheet with center at (h,k,l) and radii a, b, and c in the x, y, and z directions, respectively, is:
$$
\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2}+\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2}-\frac{(z-l)^2}{c^2}=1
$$

#### Hyperboloid of two sheets

A hyperboloid of two sheets is a quadric surface that consists of two mirror-image sheets, each of which is hyperboloid in shape. The equation of a hyperboloid of two sheets with center at (h,k,l) and radii a, b, and c in the x, y, and z directions, respectively, is:
$$
\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2}-\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2}-\frac{(z-l)^2}{c^2}=1
$$

#### Elliptic cone

An elliptic cone is a quadric surface that consists of all the points that are a fixed distance from a given point called the vertex of the cone, and the cross section perpendicular to the axis is an ellipse. The equation of an elliptic cone with vertex at (h,k,l) and semi-axes a and b in the x and y directions, respectively, is:
$$
\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2}+\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2}=\frac{(z-l)^2}{c^2}
$$

#### Elliptic paraboloid

An elliptic paraboloid is a quadric surface that is shaped like a bowl, and its cross section perpendicular to the axis is an ellipse. The equation of an elliptic paraboloid with vertex at (h,k,l) and semi-axes a, b, and c in the x, y, and z directions, respectively, is:
$$
\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2}+\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2}=\frac{z-l}{c}
$$

#### Hyperbolic paraboloid

A hyperbolic paraboloid is a quadric surface that is shaped like a saddle, and its cross section perpendicular to the axis is a hyperbola. The equation of a hyperbolic paraboloid with vertex at (h,k,l) and semi-axes a, b, and c in the x, y, and z directions, respectively, is:
$$
\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2}-\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2}=\frac{z-l}{c}
$$

### Other Surfaces

There are other surfaces in three-space that don't fit into the categories of cylinders or quadric surfaces:

#### Plane

A plane is a flat surface that extends infinitely in all directions. The equation of a plane with normal vector $\vec{n}=(a,b,c)$ and containing a point $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is:
$$
a(x-x_0)+b(y-y_0)+c(z-z_0)=0
$$

#### Torus

A torus is a surface that is shaped like a donut. The equation of a torus with center at (h,k,l), major radius R, and minor radius r is:
$$
(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}-R)^2+z^2=r^2
$$

These are just a few examples of the types of surfaces that can be encountered in multivariable calculus. Understanding these surfaces and their equations is important for visualizing and analyzing functions of multiple variables in three-dimensional space.
