# 11.5 Vector-Valued Functions and Curvilinear Motion

After the previous study, both the operations of vectors and the basic theorems of vectors, you can think of them as tools, that is, they are meant to make you understand and operate better the next knowledge. This chapter may be a little bit difficult, but don't worry, I will try to explain it as simple and detailed as possible.

## Parametric Equations

Let's start with the basics. In single-variable calculus, we often use a single equation to describe a curve in the plane, such as $y = f(x)$. In multivariable calculus, we use a set of equations, called parametric equations, to describe a curve in three-dimensional space.

A parametric equation for a curve is a set of equations that describe the position of a point on the curve as a function of one or more parameters. For example, suppose we want to describe a curve in three-dimensional space. We can use the following parametric equations:
$$
x(t)=cos(t)
$$

$$
y(t)=sin(t)
$$

$$
z(t)=t
$$

These equations describe a helix that winds around the $z$-axis. The parameter $t$ is a variable that ranges over some interval, such as $t \in [0, 2\pi]$.



If you find it difficult to accept, you can listen to my next example.

A parametric equation is a way of describing the position of a point using a variable called a parameter. For example, if you want to draw a circle, you can use the equation $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$, where r is the radius of the circle. But this equation only tells you if a point is on the circle or not, it doesn’t tell you how to move along the circle. A parametric equation can do that by using another variable, usually called t, to represent how far you have gone around the circle. One possible parametric equation for a circle is:
$$
x = r cos(t)
$$

$$
y = r sin(t)
$$

This means that the $x$-coordinate of a point on the circle is equal to the radius times the cosine of $t$, and the $y$-coordinate is equal to the radius times the sine of $t$. As t changes from 0 to $2π$, you can trace out the whole circle.

A vivid example of a parametric equation is a roller coaster. Imagine you are riding a roller coaster that goes up and down and left and right. You can use a parametric equation to describe your position at any time. For example, suppose your roller coaster has this parametric equation:
$$
x = 10 cos(t)
$$

$$
y = 10 sin(t)
$$

$$
z = t
$$

This means that your $x$-coordinate is equal to 10 times the cosine of $t$, your $y$-coordinate is equal to 10 times the sine of $t$, and your $z$-coordinate is equal to $t$. As $t$ increases, you move around a circle in the $xy$-plane, but also go up and down along the $z$-axis. You can imagine this as a spiral or a corkscrew shape.

Parametric equations are useful because they can describe curves and surfaces that are hard to express with other types of equations. They also allow you to control how fast or slow you move along the curve or surface by changing the parameter. You can also use more than one parameter if you need to describe more complicated shapes.

## Vector-Valued Functions

### Introduction

A vector-valued function is a function that takes one or more numbers as input and gives a vector as output. A vector is an arrow that has a length and a direction. For example, if you throw a ball in the air, you can describe its position at any time with a vector that points from the origin to the ball. A vector-valued function can tell you how this position vector changes over time.

One way to write a vector-valued function is to use three functions for the $x$, $y$, and $z$ coordinates of the output vector. For example, $r(t) = ⟨x(t), y(t), z(t)⟩$ is a vector-valued function that depends on one variable t. You can think of t as time, and $r(t)$ as the position of an object at time $t$.

To graph a vector-valued function, you can plot the points that the output vector points to for different values of $t$. For example, if $r(t) = ⟨t − 1, t^2⟩$, you can graph it by plugging in different values of t and drawing the points $(t − 1, t^2)$. You can also draw arrows from the origin to these points to show the output vectors.

A simple example of a vector-valued function is $r(t) = ⟨cos(t), sin(t)⟩$. This function describes a circle in the $xy$-plane with radius 1 and center at the origin. The output vector $r(t)$ rotates around the origin as t changes. You can see this by plugging in different values of $t$ and drawing the output vectors.

### Explanation

A vector-valued function is a function that maps a scalar parameter to a vector in some vector space. In the context of multivariable calculus, we use vector-valued functions to describe curves and surfaces in space.

A vector-valued function in three-dimensional space takes the form
$$
r(t) = ⟨x(t), y(t), z(t)⟩
$$
where $x(t)$, $y(t)$, and $z(t)$ are scalar functions of the parameter $t$. The vector $\mathbf{r}(t)$ describes the position of a point on the curve or surface as a function of the parameter $t$.

For example, the helix described by the parametric equations above can be written as a vector-valued function:
$$
r(t) = ⟨cos(t), sin(t),t⟩
$$

## Tangent Vectors and Curvature

Imagine you are riding a bike on a curved road. The road is the curve, and your bike is moving along it. The tangent vector is the direction that your bike is pointing at any moment. It is always touching the curve, but not crossing it. The curvature is a measure of how much the curve bends or twists at any point. The more the curve bends or twists, the higher the curvature is.

For example, if you are riding on a straight road, your tangent vector is always pointing in the same direction, and the curvature is zero. If you are riding on a circular road, your tangent vector is always changing direction as you go around the circle, and the curvature is constant and positive. If you are riding on a wavy road, your tangent vector and curvature change depending on where you are on the wave.

To find the tangent vector and curvature mathematically, we need to use some formulas that involve derivatives and integrals. A derivative is a way of finding how fast something changes, and an integral is a way of finding how much something accumulates. For example, if you know how fast your bike is going (the speed), you can find how far you have traveled (the distance) by using an integral. If you know how far you have traveled (the distance), you can find how fast your bike is going (the speed) by using a derivative.

One of the key concepts in vector-valued functions is the tangent vector. The tangent vector to a curve at a given point is the vector that points in the direction of the curve at that point.

The tangent vector to a vector-valued function $\mathbf{r}(t)$ at a given point $\mathbf{r}(t_0)$ is given by the derivative of the function with respect to the parameter $t$ evaluated at $t_0$:
$$
r'(t_0)=\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{r(t_0+h)-r(t_0)}{h} 
$$
This tangent vector describes the direction and rate of change of the position vector $\mathbf{r}(t)$ at the point $\mathbf{r}(t_0)$.

Another important concept is the curvature of a curve. The curvature measures how much the curve deviates from a straight line at a given point. For a smooth curve, the curvature is given by:
$$
\kappa =\frac{||r'(t)\times r''(t)||}{||r'(t)||^3} 
$$
where $\mathbf{r}'(t)$ and $\mathbf{r}''(t)$ are the first and second derivatives of the vector-valued function with respect to the parameter $t$, respectively.

The curvature is a scalar quantity that measures the rate at which the tangent vector is changing as we move along the curve. A high curvature indicates that the curve is changing direction rapidly, while a low curvature indicates that the curve is changing direction slowly.

## Arc Length

Another important concept in vector-valued functions is arc length. The arc length of a curve is the distance traveled along the curve from one point to another.

<img src=".\Figure\Figure 16 Arc Length.png" alt="Figure 16 Arc Length" style="zoom:50%;" />

The arc length of a curve can be calculated using the following formula:
$$
s = \int_{a}^{b} ||r'(t)||dt
$$
where $\mathbf{r}(t)$ is a vector-valued function that describes the curve, and $a$ and $b$ are the starting and ending values of the parameter $t$, respectively. The integral computes the distance traveled by integrating the magnitude of the tangent vector along the curve.

## Unit Tangent and Normal Vectors

In mathematics, a unit tangent vector is a vector that has a length of 1 and is tangent to a curve at a given point. It represents the direction of motion of the curve at that point. The unit normal vector is perpendicular to the unit tangent vector and points towards the center of curvature of the curve at that point.

For example, imagine you are driving a car along a curved road. The unit tangent vector represents the direction you are driving in at any given point along the road, while the unit normal vector represents the direction you would turn if you were to keep driving straight ahead but your car was suddenly lifted off the ground and turned perpendicular to the road.

<img src=".\Figure\Figure 17 Tangent and Normal Vectors.png" alt="Figure 17 Tangent and Normal Vectors" style="zoom:50%;" />

The unit tangent vector is a unit vector that points in the direction of the tangent vector. It can be computed as:
$$
\mathrm{T} (t)= \frac{r'(t)}{||r'(t)||} 
$$
The unit normal vector is a unit vector that is orthogonal to the tangent vector and points toward the center of curvature. It can be computed as:
$$
\mathrm{N} (t)= \frac{r''(t)-(r''(t)\cdot \mathrm{T}(t))\mathrm{T}(t) }{||r''(t)-(r''(t)\cdot \mathrm{T(t))\mathrm{T}(t)||}}
$$
The binormal vector is the cross product of the unit tangent and normal vectors:
$$
\mathrm{B}(t)=\mathrm{T}(t)\times \mathrm{N}(t)
$$
Together, the unit tangent, normal, and binormal vectors form a set of orthonormal vectors that are tangent to the curve at each point.

## Curvilinear Motion

Curvilinear motion is the motion of an object that moves along a curved path. For example, when you throw a ball in the air at an angle, it follows a curvilinear motion. Another example is when you ride a bicycle on a circular track, you are also moving in a curvilinear motion.

To understand curvilinear motion better, you can imagine that the object has two components of velocity: one that is tangent to the curve (along the direction of the motion), and one that is normal to the curve (perpendicular to the direction of the motion). The tangent velocity determines how fast the object is moving along the curve, while the normal velocity determines how much the object is changing its direction. The normal velocity also causes an acceleration that is called centripetal acceleration, which pulls the object towards the center of the curve.

For example, when you throw a ball in the air at an angle, it has an initial tangent velocity that makes it go up and forward, and an initial normal velocity that makes it go sideways. As the ball moves along the curve, its tangent velocity decreases due to gravity, while its normal velocity remains constant. This means that the ball slows down as it goes up, and speeds up as it goes down. The normal velocity also causes a centripetal acceleration that makes the ball curve towards the ground.

When you ride a bicycle on a circular track, you have a constant tangent velocity that makes you go around the circle, and a constant normal velocity that makes you lean towards the center of the circle. The normal velocity also causes a centripetal acceleration that keeps you on the circular path. If you increase your tangent velocity, you will need to increase your normal velocity as well to maintain the same centripetal acceleration. This means that you will need to lean more towards the center of the circle.

Finally, we can use vector-valued functions to describe the motion of a particle in space. If we know the position of a particle as a function of time, we can write:
$$
r(t) = ⟨x(t), y(t), z(t)⟩
$$
where $x(t)$, $y(t)$, and $z(t)$ are functions that describe the position of the particle at time $t$. The velocity of the particle is the derivative of the position vector with respect to time:
$$
\mathrm{v}(t) = \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}  =\left \langle x'(t), y'(t),z'(t)\right \rangle
$$
The acceleration of the particle is the derivative of the velocity vector with respect to time:
$$
\mathrm{a}(t) = \frac{\mathrm{d} \mathrm{v}}{\mathrm{d} t}  =\left \langle x''(t), y''(t),z''(t)\right \rangle
$$
We can use the concepts of tangent vectors, curvature, and unit normal vectors to analyze the motion of a particle in more detail.

For example, the curvature of the path of a particle gives us an indication of how difficult it is to change the direction of its motion. Similarly, the unit tangent and normal vectors give us information about the direction of motion and the orientation of the particle's path relative to its motion.
