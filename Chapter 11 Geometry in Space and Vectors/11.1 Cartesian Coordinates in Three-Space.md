# 11.1 Cartesian Coordinates in Three-Space

Cartesian Coordinates are a way of representing points in three-dimensional space using three real numbers. In this system, each point is located at a unique position described by its coordinates, which are measured along three perpendicular axes, typically labeled x, y, and z. These axes are also known as the Cartesian axes.

## Notation and Representation

A point in three-space is represented by an ordered triple `(x,y,z)` of real numbers. The first number, `x`, represents the distance from the point to the `yz-plane`, measured along the `x-axis`. The second number, `y`, represents the distance from the point to the `xz-plane`, measured along the `y-axis`. The third number, `z`, represents the distance from the point to the `xy-plane`, measured along the z-axis.

## The Distance Formula

In three-dimensional space, we can use the Euclidean distance formula to calculate the distance between two points. Suppose there are two points $A=(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ and $B=(x_2,y_2,z_2)$, the Euclidean distance between them can be expressed as

$$
d=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2+(z_2-z_1)^2}
$$
This formula can be proved by the Pythagorean theorem. We can connect the points $A$ and $B$ into a line segment and assume that the length of this line segment is $d$. Then we project this line onto the three axes to get three line segments, $x_2-x_1$, $y_2-y_1$ and $z_2-z_1$.

Next, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to prove the Euclidean distance formula. According to the Pythagorean Theorem, if the two right-angled sides of a right triangle are $a$ and $b$, and the hypotenuse is $c$, then we have $a^2+b^2=c^2$.

We can consider the line segments $x_2-x_1$, $y_2-y_1$ and $z_2-z_1$ as the two right-angled sides of three right triangles, and the hypotenuse is the distance $d$ between the points $A$ and $B$. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have:

$$
(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2+(z_2-z_1)^2=d^2
$$
Squaring both sides of the equation yields the Euclidean distance formula:

$$
d=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2+(z_2-z_1)^2}
$$
Therefore, the Euclidean distance formula can be proved by the Pythagorean theorem.



## Midpoint Formula

The midpoint of a line segment in three-space can be calculated using the midpoint formula:
$$
(x,y,z) = (\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}, \frac{z_1 + z_2}{2})
$$
Where `(x1, y1, z1)` and `(x2, y2, z2)` are the coordinates of the endpoints of the line segment. This formula calculates the coordinates of the point that is equidistant from the two endpoints.

> In conclusion, Cartesian Coordinates in Three-Space provide a way to represent points in three-dimensional space using three real numbers. The distance formula and midpoint formula allow us to calculate distances and midpoints of line segments in three-space. These concepts are essential in the study of multivariable calculus and have many applications in physics, engineering, and other fields.



## Spheres and Their Equations

### Equations

Spheres are a type of three-dimensional object that are defined as the set of all points that are a fixed distance from a given point, called the center. The distance from the center to any point on the sphere is called the radius. In multivariable calculus, we often work with equations that describe the geometry of spheres in three-dimensional space.

The equation of a sphere with center $(a, b, c)$ and radius $r$ is given by:
$$
(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2 = r^2
$$
This equation can also be written in vector from as:
$$
(\vec{X}-\vec{C})(\vec{X}-\vec{C})=r^2
$$
where $\mathbf{x} = \langle x, y, z \rangle$ is a vector representing a point in three-dimensional space, $\mathbf{c} = \langle a, b, c \rangle$ is the center of the sphere, and $\cdot$ represents the dot product of two vectors.

To derive the equation of a sphere, we start by considering a point $(x, y, z)$ on the surface of the sphere. Since this point is a fixed distance $r$ from the center $(a, b, c)$, we have:
$$
(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2 = r^2
$$
We can also use this equation to find the center and radius of a sphere given its equation. If we expand the equation, we get:
$$
x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by +b^2 + z^2 - 2cz + c^2 = r^2
$$
Comparing this to the general form of a quadratic equation in three variables:
$$
Ax^2 + By^2 + Cz^2 + Dx + Ey + F =0
$$
we can see that the center of the sphere is $(a, b, c)$, and the radius is $\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2-r^2}$.

### What is a Sphere?

A sphere can be defined mathematically as a set of points in three-dimensional space that are at a fixed distance, called the radius (r), from a central point, called the center (C).

Using markdown syntax, the equation for a sphere can be written as:
$$
(x - Cx)^2 + (y - Cy)^2 + (z - Cz)^2 = r^2
$$
where `(x, y, z)` are the coordinates of any point on the surface of the sphere, and `(Cx, Cy, Cz)` are the coordinates of the center of the sphere.

Visually, a sphere can be represented as a solid, perfectly round object with no flat sides or edges. It is similar in shape to a ball or a globe. Every point on the surface of the sphere is equidistant from the center, and the distance from the center to any point on the surface is equal to the radius of the sphere.



## Graph in Three-Space

In multivariable calculus, we often work with graphs in three-dimensional space. A graph in three-space is a set of points $(x,y,z)$ that satisfy an equation of the form $z=f(x,y)$, where $f(x,y)$ is a function of two variables. In other words, a graph in three-space is a surface.

To visualize a graph in three-space, we can use a three-dimensional coordinate system with three mutually perpendicular axes: the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis, and the $z$-axis. Each point in three-space is represented by an ordered triple $(x,y,z)$, where $x$ is the horizontal coordinate, $y$ is the vertical coordinate, and $z$ is the depth coordinate. The point where the three axes intersect is called the origin, and is typically labeled $(0,0,0)$.

To graph a surface in three-space, we can use techniques such as level curves and contour plots. Level curves are curves in the $xy$-plane that represent the values of $z$ for which $f(x,y)$ is constant. In other words, they are curves that lie on the surface of the graph. Contour plots are two-dimensional plots that show the level curves of a function in three-space.

To find the equations of level curves, we set $z$ equal to a constant $c$ and solve for $x$ and $y$. For example, if $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2$, the level curves would be given by the equation $x^2+y^2=c$, which represents circles centered at the origin with radius $\sqrt{c}$. To visualize the graph of this function, we could plot a series of these circles at different heights above the $xy$-plane.

Another technique for visualizing graphs in three-space is to use slices. A slice is a cross-section of the graph taken by a plane perpendicular to one of the coordinate planes. For example, if we take a slice of the graph of $z=f(x,y)$ by a plane parallel to the $xy$-plane at a fixed height $z=c$, we obtain the curve $f(x,y)=c$. This curve represents the intersection of the graph with the plane $z=c$, and can be plotted in the $xy$-plane.

Here are some additional mathematical formulas that may be helpful when working with graphs in three-space:

- The distance between two points $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2,z_2)$ is given by the formula:

  > $$
  > d = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2+(z_2-z_1)^2}
  > $$

- The equation of a plane in three-space can be written in the form $ax+by+cz=d$, where $(a,b,c)$ is the normal vector to the plane and $d$ is the distance from the origin to the plane.

- The dot product of two vectors $\mathbf{u}=\langle u_1,u_2,u_3 \rangle$ and $\mathbf{v}=\langle v_1,v_2,v_3 \rangle$ is given by the formula:

  > $$
  > \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = \vec{u_1}\vec{v_1} + \vec{u_2}\vec{v_2} +\vec{u_3}\vec{v_3}
  > $$

- The cross product of two vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ is a vector $\mathbf{w}$ that is perpendicular to both $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$, and is given by the formula:

  > $$
  > \mathbf{U} \times \mathbf{V} =  
  > \begin{vmatrix}  
  >   \mathbf{i}& \mathbf{j}& \mathbf{k} \\  
  >   \vec{u_1}& \vec{u_2}& \vec{u_3}\\  
  >   \vec{v_1}& \vec{v_1}& \vec{v_1}\\  
  > \end{vmatrix}
  > $$

- The gradient of a function $f(x,y,z)$ is a vector field that points in the direction of the greatest increase of $f$, and is given by the formula:

  > $$
  > \nabla f (x,y,z)=<\cfrac{\partial f}{\partial x } ,\cfrac{\partial f}{\partial y },\cfrac{\partial f}{\partial z }>
  > $$

- The directional derivative of $f(x,y,z)$ in the direction of a unit vector $\mathbf{u}$ is given by the formula:

  > $$
  > D_uf(x,y,z)=\nabla f(x,y,z) \cdot \vec{u}
  > $$

- The partial derivatives of a function $f(x,y,z)$ can be used to find the equation of the tangent plane to the graph of $f$ at a point $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$, which is given by the equation:

  > $$
  > \cfrac{\partial f}{\partial x }(x_0,y_0,z_0)(x-x_0) +\cfrac{\partial f}{\partial y }(x_0,y_0,z_0)(y-y_0) +\cfrac{\partial f}{\partial z }(x_0,y_0,z_0)(z-z_0) =0
  > $$

These are just a few of the mathematical formulas that are used when working with graphs in three-space. Other techniques and formulas include partial derivatives, double and triple integrals, parametric equations, and vector fields.

When solving problems involving graphs in three-space, it can be helpful to start by visualizing the graph and identifying any symmetries or patterns. From there, we can use techniques such as level curves, slices, and gradients to gain a deeper understanding of the graph and its behavior. We can also use calculus techniques such as partial derivatives and integrals to calculate various properties of the graph, such as its slope, curvature, and volume.
