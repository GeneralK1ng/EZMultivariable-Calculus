# 11.7 Curvature and Components of Acceleration

## Curvature

### Introduction

Curvature is a way of measuring how much something bends or curves. For example, a straight line has zero curvature, because it does not bend at all. A circle has a constant curvature, because it bends the same amount everywhere. A curve that bends more has a higher curvature than a curve that bends less.

One way to think about curvature is to imagine a tiny bug crawling along a curve. The bug can only see what is right in front of it, so it does not know the shape of the whole curve. However, it can feel how much it has to turn its body as it moves along. The more it has to turn, the higher the curvature of the curve.

A vivid example of introducing curvature is to use a bicycle wheel. You can hold the wheel in different ways and spin it around. If you hold the wheel flat, like a pizza, then the wheel does not bend at all. It has zero curvature. If you hold the wheel upright, like a coin, then the wheel bends in one direction only. It has positive curvature. If you hold the wheel diagonally, like a saddle, then the wheel bends in two opposite directions. It has negative curvature.

You can also use the bicycle wheel to show how curvature depends on direction. If you hold the wheel upright and spin it around its vertical axis, then you see a circle with positive curvature. But if you spin it around its horizontal axis, then you see a straight line with zero curvature. So the same wheel can have different curvatures depending on how you look at it.

### Explanation

Curvature is a measure of how much a curve deviates from being a straight line. In multivariable calculus, we are usually concerned with curves in three-dimensional space. The curvature of a curve at a particular point is defined as the reciprocal of the radius of the osculating circle at that point. The osculating circle is the circle that best approximates the curve at that point.

### Formula for Curvature

The formula for curvature is:
$$
k = \frac{|T'(s)|}{||r'(s)||}
$$
where `T(s)` is the unit tangent vector to the curve at the point with parameter `s`, `r(s)` is the position vector of the curve at that point, `T'(s)` is the derivative of the tangent vector with respect to `s`, and `||r'(s)||` is the magnitude of the velocity vector.

### Intuition behind the Formula

The curvature measures the rate at which the tangent vector is changing as we move along the curve. If the curve is nearly straight, then the tangent vector doesn't change much, and the curvature is small. If the curve is sharply curved, then the tangent vector changes rapidly, and the curvature is large.

## Components of Acceleration

Components of acceleration are a way of splitting the acceleration vector into two parts: one that is along the direction of motion, and one that is perpendicular to it. The part that is along the direction of motion is called the tangential component, and it tells us how much the speed is changing. The part that is perpendicular to the direction of motion is called the normal component, and it tells us how much the direction is changing.

One way to think about components of acceleration is to imagine a car driving on a curved road. The car has a speedometer that tells us how fast it is going, and a compass that tells us which direction it is facing. The tangential component of acceleration is like the speedometer: it shows us if the car is speeding up or slowing down. The normal component of acceleration is like the compass: it shows us if the car is turning left or right.

A vivid example of introducing components of acceleration is to use a roller coaster. You can feel different forces acting on your body as you ride along the track. When you go up or down a hill, you feel a force pushing you forward or backward. This force is due to the tangential component of acceleration, which changes your speed. When you go around a loop or a curve, you feel a force pushing you sideways or inward. This force is due to the normal component of acceleration, which changes your direction.

You can also use a roller coaster to show how components of acceleration depend on speed and curvature. The faster you go, the greater the tangential component of acceleration will be when you go up or down a hill. The sharper the curve or loop, the greater the normal component of acceleration will be when you go around it.

The binormal vector is a vector that is perpendicular to both the tangent vector and the normal vector of a curve. It is usually denoted by B and it forms an orthonormal basis with T and N, called the Frenet-Serret frame. The binormal vector tells us how much the curve twists out of the plane that contains T and N.

One example of a binormal vector is for a helix, which is a curve that wraps around a cylinder. The tangent vector T is always tangent to the helix, the normal vector N is always pointing towards the axis of the cylinder, and the binormal vector B is always parallel to the axis of the cylinder. The binormal vector does not change its direction as we move along the helix, but it changes its length depending on how tightly the helix is wound. The tighter the helix, the smaller the binormal vector. The length of the binormal vector is related to the torsion of the curve, which measures how fast the curve twists.

### Formula for Tangential Component of Acceleration

The formula for the tangential component of acceleration is:
$$
aT = \frac{dV }{dt}
$$
where `V` is the speed of the object, and $\frac{dV }{dt}$ is the rate of change of speed with respect to time.

### Formula for Normal Component of Acceleration

The formula for the normal component of acceleration is:
$$
aN = ||a|| \times sin(\theta)
$$
where `||a||` is the magnitude of the acceleration vector, and $\theta$ is the angle between the acceleration vector and the unit tangent vector.

### Formula for Binormal Component of Acceleration

The formula for the binormal component of acceleration is:
$$
aB = ||a|| \times cos(\theta) \times k \times N
$$
where `||a||` is the magnitude of the acceleration vector, $\theta$ is the angle between the acceleration vector and the unit tangent vector, `k` is the curvature of the path, and `N` is the unit normal vector to the path.
