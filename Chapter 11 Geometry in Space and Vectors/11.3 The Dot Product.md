# 11.3 The Dot Product

In the previous section 11.3 we learned some basics of vectors and some basic operations of vectors in general, which should not be particularly difficult for everyone at the moment, so in this section we will learn a simple concept mentioned in the previous section in concrete terms, which is really simple, believe me, and that is - $inner -product$.

In multivariable calculus, the inner product, also known as the dot product, is a fundamental concept that plays an important role in many areas of mathematics, physics, and engineering. It is a way of measuring the degree of similarity or alignment between two vectors in a Euclidean space.

The inner product of two vectors is defined as the product of their magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between them. Geometrically, it can be interpreted as the projection of one vector onto the other, multiplied by the magnitude of the other vector. It is denoted by the symbol · or < , >, and can be expressed in terms of the components of the vectors as:
$$
u · v = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + ... + u_nv_n
$$
where u and v are vectors in n-dimensional Euclidean space, and $u_1, u_2, ..., u_n$ and $v_1, v_2, ..., v_n$ are their corresponding components.

The dot product satisfies several important properties, such as commutativity $(u · v = v · u)$, distributivity $(u · (v + w) = u · v + u · w)$, and associativity with scalar multiplication $((k u) · v = k (u · v))$, among others. It also allows us to define the magnitude of a vector as the square root of its dot product with itself, i.e., $||u|| = \sqrt{u · u}$.

The inner product has many applications in geometry, physics, and engineering, such as determining the angle between two vectors, finding the projection of one vector onto another, computing work done by a force on an object, and calculating the norm of a matrix, among others.

## Theorems

Next we will learn some necessary theorems, very simple, I try to express the process of proof and description as concise and vivid as possible, if there are doubts, please ask me. If you really can't understand it, but you have to deal with the exam, there is no way, then please memorize these formulas by heart.

### Theorem A: properties of the Dot Product

If $u$, $v$, and $w$ are vectors, and $c$ is a scalar, then

- $u \cdot v = v \cdot u$

- $u \cdot (v + u) = u \cdot v + u \cdot w$
- $c(u \cdot v)=(cu) \cdot v$
- $0 \cdot u = 0$
- $u \cdot u = ||u||^2$

### Theorem B

If $\theta$ is the smallest nonnegative angle between the nonzero vectors $u$ and $v$ , then 
$$
u \cdot v = ||u||||v||cos\theta
$$
$Proof$ 

To prove that $u · v = ||u|| ||v|| cos θ$, we can start by expressing u and v in terms of their components using standard unit vectors or basis vectors. Let $u = (u1, u2, u3) $ and $v = (v1, v2, v3)$, and let θ be the angle between $u$ and $v$.

Then, the dot product of $u$ and $v$ can be expressed as:
$$
u · v = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + u_3v_3
$$
The magnitudes of u and v can be expressed as:
$$
||u|| = \sqrt{u_1^2 + u_2^2 + u_3^2}
$$

$$
||v|| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + v_3^2}
$$

Using the properties of the dot product, we can express the cosine of the angle between u and v in terms of their components:
$$
cos θ = \frac{u · v}{||u|| ||v||} 
$$
Substituting $u · v$ and $||u||$ and $||v||$, we get:
$$
cos θ = \frac{u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + u_3v_3}{\sqrt{u_1^2 + u_2^2 + u_3^2} \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + v_3^2}}
$$
Multiplying both sides by $||u|| ||v||$, we get:
$$
||u|| ||v|| cos θ = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + u_3v_3
$$
But this is just the expression for $u · v$ that we started with, so we have shown that:
$$
u · v = ||u|| ||v|| cos θ
$$
as desired.

This equation is a fundamental result in linear algebra and has many important applications in geometry, physics, and engineering, such as determining the angle between two vectors, finding the projection of one vector onto another, and calculating work done by a force on an object, among others.

### Theorem C: Perpendicular Criterion

The Perpendicular Criterion theorem states that two vectors in a Euclidean space are perpendicular, or orthogonal, if and only if their dot product is equal to zero.

In other words, if $u$ and $v$ are two vectors in a Euclidean space, then u and v are perpendicular if and only if:
$$
u ⋅ v = 0
$$
Geometrically, this means that the angle between u and v is 90 degrees, since the cosine of a 90 degree angle is zero.

The Perpendicular Criterion theorem is a very useful tool in multivariable calculus and linear algebra, as it allows us to easily determine whether two vectors are perpendicular without having to explicitly calculate their angle or projection. It also has important applications in physics, engineering, and other fields where vectors are commonly used to represent physical quantities.

For example, if we are given the velocity and force vectors of an object in a physical system, we can use the Perpendicular Criterion theorem to determine whether the force is acting perpendicular to the motion of the object, which is important in understanding the dynamics of the system. Similarly, in computer graphics and computer vision, the Perpendicular Criterion theorem is used to calculate lighting and shading effects, as well as to determine the orientation of objects in 3D space.

> $Definition Orthogonal$
>
> Vectors that are perpendicular are said to be orthogonal.



$Proof$

Here's a proof of the Perpendicular Criterion theorem using the definition of the dot product:

Let $u$ and $v$ be two vectors in a Euclidean space. By the definition of the dot product, we have:
$$
u ⋅ v = ||u|| ||v|| cosθ
$$
where $θ$ is the angle between $u$ and $v$.

If $u$ and $v$ are perpendicular, then $θ = 90°$, so $cosθ = 0$, and hence $u ⋅ v = 0$.

Conversely, suppose that $u ⋅ v = 0$. Then we have:

$||u - v||^2 = (u - v) ⋅ (u - v)$

$= u ⋅ u - u ⋅ v - v ⋅ u + v ⋅ v $    (by the distributive property)         

$= ||u||^2 - 2(u ⋅ v) + ||v||^2$    (by the definition of the dot product)         

$= ||u||^2 - 2(0) + ||v||^2    (since u ⋅ v = 0)$        

$= ||u||^2 + ||v||^2$

Since $||u - v||^2$ is the sum of two non-negative numbers, it follows that $||u - v||^2 ≥ 0$, with equality if and only if $u - v = 0$, which means that $u = v$.

Therefore, if $u ⋅ v = 0$, then $u = v$ or $u$ and $v$ are perpendicular.

This completes the proof of the Perpendicular Criterion theorem.

The formula for the Perpendicular Criterion theorem is simply:

$u ⋅ v = 0$ if and only if $u$ and $v$ are perpendicular.



## Direction Angles and Cosines

In multivariable calculus, directional angles and cosines are used to describe the orientation of a vector in three-dimensional space.

Let's consider a vector $\vec{v}$ in three-dimensional space with components $(v_1, v_2, v_3)$. We can define the directional angles of $\vec{v}$ with respect to the positive $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes as follows:

1. The angle $\theta_x$ between $\vec{v}$ and the positive $x$-axis is given by:

$$
cos\theta_x = \frac{v_1}{\sqrt{v_1^2+v_2^2+v_3^2}}
$$

2. The angle $\theta_y$ between $\vec{v}$ and the positive $y$-axis is given by:

$$
cos\theta_y = \frac{v_1}{\sqrt{v_1^2+v_2^2+v_3^2}}
$$

3. The angle $\theta_z$ between $\vec{v}$ and the positive $z$-axis is given by:

$$
cos\theta_z = \frac{v_1}{\sqrt{v_1^2+v_2^2+v_3^2}}
$$

The directional cosines are simply the cosine values of these angles:
$$
cos\theta_x,cos\theta_y,cos\theta_z
$$
It is important to note that the sum of the squares of the directional cosines is always equal to 1:
$$
cos^2\theta_x+cos^2\theta_y+cos^2\theta_z=1
$$
This property is known as the direction cosine theorem.

Now, let's consider some practical ideas and points to solve problems involving directional angles and cosines:

1. When given a vector in component form, you can use the formulas above to calculate the directional angles and cosines.
2. When given the directional cosines, you can use the direction cosine theorem to check if they are valid.
3. When given two vectors, you can find the angle between them using the dot product and the magnitudes of the vectors. This can be useful in finding the directional angles and cosines of a vector.
4. When given a vector and a plane, you can find the angle between the vector and the normal to the plane using the dot product. This can be useful in finding the directional angles and cosines of the vector with respect to the plane.
5. When given a set of three vectors, you can use the cross product to find the normal to the plane containing two of the vectors. This can be useful in finding the directional angles and cosines of the third vector with respect to the plane.

Overall, the relationship between directional angles and cosines is an important concept in multivariable calculus, as it allows us to describe the orientation of vectors in three-dimensional space. 

## Projection

In mathematics, the projection of a vector onto another vector is the component of the first vector that lies in the direction of the second vector. Geometrically, this means that we are finding the shadow of the first vector on the second vector.

To understand the mathematical principles behind projection, let's first define some terms. Let `u` and `v` be two non-zero vectors in a three-dimensional space. The projection of `u` onto `v` is denoted by `proj_v u`. This is a vector that has the same direction as `v`, but a different magnitude. The magnitude of `proj_v u` is the length of the shadow of `u` on `v`.

The projection of `u` onto `v` is given by the formula:
$$
proj_v u = \frac{u · v}{||v||^2} v
$$
where `·` represents the dot product of two vectors.

This formula can be derived geometrically by noting that the projection of `u` onto `v` is the vector `w` that satisfies the following conditions:

1. `w` is parallel to `v`
2. `w` is collinear with `u`
3. `w` has the same direction as `u`

To find `w`, we can start by drawing a line from the tip of `u` perpendicular to `v`. This creates a right-angled triangle, with `v` as the hypotenuse. The length of the adjacent side of this triangle is the magnitude of `proj_v u`, and the length of the opposite side is the magnitude of the component of `u` perpendicular to `v`. Using trigonometry, we can express these lengths in terms of the dot product `u · v` and the magnitude of `v`. By rearranging these expressions, we arrive at the formula for `proj_v u`.

<img src=".\Figure\Figure 10 Projections.png" alt="Figure 10 Projections" style="zoom:50%;" />

Now, let's consider some practical strategies and methods for solving problems involving projection.

One common problem is to find the projection of a vector `u` onto a plane. To do this, we can first find a vector `n` that is perpendicular to the plane. This can be done by taking the cross product of two vectors that lie in the plane. Once we have `n`, we can find the projection of `u` onto `n` using the formula we just discussed. The projection of `u` onto the plane is then obtained by subtracting the projection of `u` onto `n` from `u`.

Another common problem is to find the distance between a point and a line in space. To do this, we can first find a vector `v` that points along the line. This can be done by taking the difference between two points on the line. We can then find the projection of the vector from the point to the line onto `v`. The magnitude of this projection is the distance between the point and the line.

In summary, projection is a fundamental concept in linear algebra that has many practical applications in geometry and physics. By understanding the mathematical principles behind projection and using the appropriate strategies and methods, we can solve a wide range of problems involving vectors in space.



## Planes

In the context of multivariable calculus, planes are important mathematical objects that are used to study functions of two or three variables. Here's a brief overview of some key concepts related to planes:

1. Equation of a Plane: A plane in three-dimensional space can be described by an equation of the form $ax + by + cz = d$, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants that define the orientation of the plane, and `d` is a constant that defines the distance of the plane from the origin. This is known as the standard form of the equation of a plane.
2. Normal Vector: The vector $n = <a, b, c>$ is known as the normal vector of the plane. This vector is perpendicular to the plane, and its direction determines the orientation of the plane.
3. Point-Normal Form: Another way to define a plane is using a point and a normal vector. Given a point $P = (x_0, y_0, z_0)$ on the plane and a normal vector $n = <a, b, c>$, the equation of the plane can be written as $n \cdot (r - P) = 0$, where $r = <x, y, z>$ is a point on the plane.
4. Vector Equation of a Line: A line in three-dimensional space can be described by a vector equation of the form `r = p + tv`, where $p = <x_0, y_0, z_0>$ is a point on the line and $v = <a, b, c>$ is a direction vector for the line.
5. Intersection of a Line and a Plane: Given a line with vector equation `r = p + tv` and a plane with equation $ax + by + cz = d$, we can find the point of intersection between the line and the plane by solving the system of equations $ax + by + cz = d$ and $x = x_0 + ta, y = y_0 + tb, z = z_0 + tc$ simultaneously.
6. Distance from a Point to a Plane: Given a plane with equation $ax + by + cz = d$ and a point $P = (x_0, y_0, z_0)$ that is not on the plane, we can find the distance between the point and the plane using the formula $distance = \frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0 - d|}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}  $.

These concepts are all interrelated and are essential for understanding the geometry of planes in three-dimensional space.

Good, I believe you already understand the concept of inner product or dot product, and almost understand some geometric meaning of the operation between vectors, and also know how to use these formulas. Then we can move on to a new concept - the outer product or fork product.
