# 11.4 The Cross Product

If you were a Chinese high school student before, I think those previous points of knowledge are estimated to be difficult to beat you at all, if you are a student in the United States Britain or in addition to China, it does not matter, my notes aim to try to make the knowledge become clear to understand easy to understand, if you have questions welcome to contact me! So the concepts you will learn today will be a little more difficult to understand than yesterday, but don't be afraid, follow my steps and learn step by step, then welcome to - Cross Product (Outer Product).

The outer product, also known as the vector or cross product, is a fundamental operation in multivariable calculus that relates two vectors in three-dimensional space. The outer product is used to calculate the vector that is perpendicular to both input vectors, and its magnitude is equal to the area of the parallelogram defined by the two input vectors.

To understand this concept more clearly, let's start with the definition. Given two vectors **a** and **b**, their outer product is denoted by **a** x **b**, and is defined as follows:
$$
a \times b = |a||b|sin(θ) n
$$
where |**a**| and |**b**| are the magnitudes of the two vectors, θ is the angle between them, and **n** is the unit vector that is perpendicular to the plane defined by the two input vectors.

The formula for the outer product may seem complicated, but it is actually quite intuitive once you understand the geometric meaning. Imagine two vectors, **a** and **b**, that are not parallel. The angle between these vectors is θ, and the area of the parallelogram defined by the two vectors is |**a**||**b**|sin(θ). The direction of the perpendicular vector, **n**, is determined by the right-hand rule: point your fingers in the direction of **a**, curl them towards **b**, and the direction of your thumb gives the direction of **n**.

In addition to its geometric meaning, the outer product has many practical applications. For example, it is used in physics to calculate torque, in computer graphics to create 3D models, and in engineering to calculate the forces acting on a structure.

It is also important to note that the outer product is not commutative, meaning that **a** x **b** is not necessarily equal to **b** x **a**. Instead, the order of the vectors matters and determines the direction of the resulting vector.

Lastly, it's worth mentioning that the outer product can be extended to higher dimensions. In four dimensions, for example, the outer product of two vectors is a bivector, which can be thought of as a plane that is perpendicular to both input vectors.

## Third order determinant

Since we are studying multivariable calculus, we are exploring the mysteries of space, so inevitably we need to use some knowledge of linear algebra, and if you have studied linear algebra then you can skip this section. But if you have not learned it does not matter, I will use the most concise language for you to explain the operation of the third-order determinant, n you ask why not talk about the higher order? (Hey, because it's not on the exam.) Because it's not covered before this program.

### What is determinant?

Determinants are mathematical objects that can be calculated from square matrices, which are arrays of numbers arranged in rows and columns. The determinant is a scalar value that is uniquely associated with each matrix and can be used to describe various properties of the matrix, including its invertibility, eigenvalues, and volume scaling factor.

The geometric meaning of a determinant can be interpreted as the factor by which the matrix scales the area or volume of a region in space. For example, the determinant of a 2x2 matrix represents the factor by which the matrix scales the area of a parallelogram, while the determinant of a 3x3 matrix represents the factor by which the matrix scales the volume of a parallelepiped.

### Second order determinant

To explain the concept of determinants, let's start with second-order determinants. A second-order determinant is a scalar value calculated from a 2x2 matrix. The general formula for a second-order determinant is:
$$
\begin{vmatrix}
 a & b\\
  c & d
\end{vmatrix}=ad-bc
$$
The vertical bars represent the determinant notation. To calculate the determinant, we take the product of the diagonal elements (a and d) and subtract the product of the off-diagonal elements (b and c).

Geometrically, a second-order determinant can be interpreted as the signed area of a parallelogram formed by two vectors (a,b) and (c,d) in the plane. If the determinant is positive, the vectors form a counterclockwise orientation, while if it is negative, they form a clockwise orientation.

### Third order determinant

Moving on to third-order determinants, a third-order determinant is a scalar value calculated from a 3x3 matrix. The general formula for a third-order determinant is:
$$
\begin{vmatrix}
 a & b & c\\
 d & e & f\\
 g & h & i
\end{vmatrix}=a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)
$$
To calculate the determinant, we expand along any row or column and use the formula of second-order determinants to calculate the sub-determinants.

Geometrically, a third-order determinant can be interpreted as the signed volume of a parallelepiped formed by three vectors (a,b,c), (d,e,f), and (g,h,i) in space. If the determinant is positive, the vectors form a right-handed orientation, while if it is negative, they form a left-handed orientation.

In general, determinants can be calculated for any square matrix of any size, and they play a crucial role in many areas of mathematics, including linear algebra, calculus, and differential equations. The geometric interpretation of determinants as scaling factors provides a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of matrices and their applications.

## Cross Product

The cross product is an operation that takes two vectors in three-dimensional space and produces a third vector that is orthogonal to both of the input vectors. The resulting vector is also known as the vector product. The cross product is defined as follows:

If $u = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and $v = (v_1, v_2, v_3)$ are two vectors in three-dimensional space, then their cross product is given by:
$$
u \times v = (u_2v_3 - u_3v_2, u_3v_1 - u_1v_3, u_1v_2 - u_2v_1)
$$
Some important concepts related to the cross product are:

- Orthogonality: The cross product of two vectors is orthogonal to both of the input vectors. This means that if u and v are non-zero vectors, then u x v is perpendicular to both u and v.
- Magnitude: The magnitude of the cross product of two vectors is equal to the area of the parallelogram that is formed by the two vectors. That is, $||u \times v|| = ||u|| ||v|| sin(\theta)$, where theta is the angle between `u` and `v`.
- Direction: The direction of the cross product can be determined by using the right-hand rule. If u and v are both pointing towards you and you curl your fingers in the direction of u, then your thumb will point in the direction of `u` x `v`.

Some important formulas related to the cross product are:

- $u \times v = -v \times u$ (cross product is anti-commutative)
- $u \times (v + w) = u \times v + u \times w$  (cross product is distributive over addition)
- $(ku) \times v = k(u \times v) = u \times (kv)$ (cross product is linear in its first argument)

In summary, the cross product is an important operation in multivariable calculus that allows us to find a vector that is orthogonal to two given vectors. It has many practical applications in various fields and can be used to solve a wide range of problems.

### Relationship between the Cross Product and the Determinant

The cross product can be expressed in terms of determinants. Specifically, the cross product of two vectors u and v can be written as:
$$
\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} =  
\begin{vmatrix}  
  \mathbf{i}& \mathbf{j}& \mathbf{k} \\  
  u_1 & u_2& u_3 \\  
  v_1& v_2& v_3 \\  
\end{vmatrix} =\begin{vmatrix}
 u_2 & u_3\\
 v_2 & v_3
\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{i}-\begin{vmatrix}
 u_1 & u_3\\
 v_1 & v_3
\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{j}+\begin{vmatrix}
 u_1 & u_2\\
 v_1 & v_2
\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{k}
$$
where $i$, $j$, and $k$ are the standard basis vectors in three dimensions.

The formula $\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} =  
\begin{vmatrix}  
  \mathbf{i}& \mathbf{j}& \mathbf{k} \\  
  u_1 & u_2& u_3 \\  
  v_1& v_2& v_3 \\  
\end{vmatrix} =\begin{vmatrix}
 u_2 & u_3\\
 v_2 & v_3
\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{i}-\begin{vmatrix}
 u_1 & u_3\\
 v_1 & v_3
\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{j}+\begin{vmatrix}
 u_1 & u_2\\
 v_1 & v_2
\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{k}$ is a way to express the cross product of two vectors $u$ and $v$ using determinants. To understand how this formula is derived, it helps to first understand the geometric interpretation of the cross product.

#### Geometric interpretation of cross product

The cross product of two vectors $u$ and $v$ in three dimensions is a third vector $w$ that is perpendicular to both $u$ and $v$. This vector $w$ has a magnitude equal to the area of the parallelogram spanned by $u$ and $v$, and its direction is given by the right-hand rule: point your fingers in the direction of $u$, curl them towards $v$, and your thumb will point in the direction of $w$.

#### Formula derivation:

To derive the formula $\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} =  
\begin{vmatrix}  
  \mathbf{i}& \mathbf{j}& \mathbf{k} \\  
  u_1 & u_2& u_3 \\  
  v_1& v_2& v_3 \\  
\end{vmatrix}$, we start by considering the cross product of two vectors u and v in component form:
$$
u \times v = (u_2v_3 - u_3v_2, u_3v_1 - u_1v_3, u_1v_2 - u_2v_1)
$$
We can write this vector as a linear combination of the standard basis vectors $i$, $j$, and $k$:
$$
u \times v = (u_2v_3 - u_3v_2)i + (u_3v_1 - u_1v_3)j + (u_1v_2 - u_2v_1)k
$$
Now we can express this as a determinant:
$$
\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} =  
\begin{vmatrix}  
  \mathbf{i}& \mathbf{j}& \mathbf{k} \\  
  u_1 & u_2& u_3 \\  
  v_1& v_2& v_3 \\  
\end{vmatrix}
$$
If we expand the determinant along the first row, we get:
$$
\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} =\begin{vmatrix}
 u_2 & u_3\\
 v_2 & v_3
\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{i}-\begin{vmatrix}
 u_1 & u_3\\
 v_1 & v_3
\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{j}+\begin{vmatrix}
 u_1 & u_2\\
 v_1 & v_2
\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{k}
$$
which is equivalent to the formula $\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} =  
\begin{vmatrix}  
  \mathbf{i}& \mathbf{j}& \mathbf{k} \\  
  u_1 & u_2& u_3 \\  
  v_1& v_2& v_3 \\  
\end{vmatrix}$.

#### Geometric meaning of the formula

The determinant $\begin{vmatrix}  
  \mathbf{i}& \mathbf{j}& \mathbf{k} \\  
  u_1 & u_2& u_3 \\  
  v_1& v_2& v_3 \\  
\end{vmatrix}$ is equal to the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the three vectors $i$, $u$, and $v$. This is because the first row of the determinant contains the basis vectors $i$, $j$, and $k$, which have unit length and are perpendicular to each other. The second and third rows of the determinant contain the components of $u$ and $v$, respectively, so the parallelepiped they span has a base of area equal to the magnitude of the cross product, and a height equal to the projection of u onto a vector perpendicular to both u and v. The sign of the determinant indicates the orientation of the parallelepiped relative to the standard orientation defined by the basis vectors $i$, $j$, and $k$. Thus, the formula  $\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} =  
\begin{vmatrix}  
  \mathbf{i}& \mathbf{j}& \mathbf{k} \\  
  u_1 & u_2& u_3 \\  
  v_1& v_2& v_3 \\  
\end{vmatrix}$ expresses the cross product as a geometric operation involving volumes and orientations.

## Theorems

### Theorem A

Let $u$ and $v$ be vectors in three-space and $\theta$ be the angle between them. Then

1. $u \cdot (u \times v) = 0 =v \cdot (u \times v)$, that is, $u \times v$ is perpendicular to both $u$ and $v$;
2. $u$,$v$, and $u \times v$ from a right-handed triple;
3. $||u \times v|| = ||u||||v||sin\theta$

> These theorems I think there should be no difficulty in understanding them with the previous padding, so here I will omit the proof steps, if you have any questions you can contact me!

### Theorem B

Two vectors $u$ and $v$ in three-space are parallel if and only if $u \times v=0$.

The formula that two vectors $u$ and $v$ in three-space are parallel if and only if their cross product $u \times v$ is equal to zero is an important result in multivariable calculus and linear algebra. It essentially states that two vectors are parallel if and only if they lie on the same line or are scalar multiples of each other.

To see why this is true, consider the geometric interpretation of the cross product. The cross product of two non-zero vectors $u$ and $v$ produces a third vector w that is orthogonal (perpendicular) to both $u$ and $v$. The magnitude of $w$ is equal to the area of the parallelogram that u and v span, and its direction is determined by the right-hand rule. If u and v are parallel, then the parallelogram they span has zero area, and therefore the magnitude of the cross product w must also be zero. This means that $u \times v = 0$.

Conversely, if $u \times v = 0$, then the magnitude of the cross product w must be zero, which implies that the area of the parallelogram spanned by $u$ and $v$ is also zero. This means that $u$ and $v$ must be parallel, or equivalently, they lie on the same line or are scalar multiples of each other.

Applications of this formula include:

1. Testing for collinearity: The formula is often used in geometry and physics to determine whether three points in three-space are collinear (lie on the same line). If the cross product of two vectors formed from three points is equal to zero, then the three points are collinear.
2. Solving equations: The formula can be used to solve systems of linear equations in three variables. If two of the equations in the system represent vectors that are parallel, then their cross product is zero, and this information can be used to simplify the system.
3. Finding perpendicular vectors: The formula can also be used to find a vector that is perpendicular to two given vectors. If $u$ and $v$ are non-zero and not parallel, then their cross product $w$ is a vector that is perpendicular to both $u$ and $v$. This can be useful in physics and engineering applications where finding a vector that is perpendicular to two given vectors is important.

### Theorem C

If $u$, $v$, and $w$ are vectors in three-space and $k$ is a scalar, then

1. $u \times v = - (v \times u)$ (anticommutative law);
2. $u \times (v+w) = (u \times v)+(u\times w)$ (left distributive law);
3. $k(u \times v)=(ku)\times v = u\times(kv)$;
4. $u \times 0 = 0 \times u = 0, u \times u = 0$;
5. $(u \times v)\cdot w = u \cdot (v\times u)$;
6. $u \times (v \times w) = (u\cdot w)v-(u\cdot v)w$.



In fact, you will find that this chapter involves nothing more than some formulas, the latter theorems you do not need to remember, because these in the front of the pavement can naturally understand, no need to memorize.

And these few formulas are not necessary to remember, you just need to follow the laws of Cross Product, first count the brackets and then count the brackets outside, I think it should not be difficult.

Next we will enter a more abstract chapter, of course, do not be afraid, I will try to explain as clear and concise as possible for you.
